<p class="sidenote">1813</p>

<p>In later years Napoleon confessed that during the interval between the
first and second Saxon campaigns he had been outwitted. His
antagonists had, in his own language, "changed for the better"; at
least they secured the war they so earnestly desired under conditions
vastly more favorable to themselves than to their opponent. Both
parties had been arming with might and main during the prolonged
truce, but each member of the dynastic coalition now had the backing
of a growing national enthusiasm, while Napoleon had to deal with
waning zeal and an exhausted people. Thus, then, at the opening of the
second campaign in Saxony, the allies had four hundred and thirty-five
thousand men, and Napoleon but three hundred and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> fifty
thousand. With this inferiority, it behooved the Emperor to use all
his strategic powers, and he did so with a brilliancy never surpassed
by him. Choosing the Elbe as his natural defensive line, Hamburg stood
almost impregnable at one end, flanked to the southward by Magdeburg,
Wittenberg, and Torgau, three mighty fortresses. Dresden, which was
necessarily the focal point, was intrenched and palisaded for the
protection of the army which was to be its main bulwark. Davout and
Oudinot, with seventy thousand men, were to threaten Berlin, and,
thereby drawing off as many as possible of the enemy, liberate the
garrisons of Stettin and Küstrin; they were then to beleaguer Spandau,
push the foe across the Oder, and stand ready to fall on the flank of
the coalition army. Napoleon himself, with the remaining two hundred
and eighty thousand, was to await the onset of the combined Russian,
Prussian, and Austrian forces.</p>

<p>The allies now had in their camp two mighty strategists&mdash;Jomini, the
well-known Swiss adventurer and military historian, and Moreau, who
had returned from the United States. The former, pleading that he had
lost a merited promotion by Berthier's ill-will, and that as a
foreigner he had the right of choice, had gone over to the enemies of
his employer; the latter, yielding to the specious pleas of his silly
and ambitious wife that he might fight Napoleon without fighting
France, had taken service with the Czar. The arrow which penetrated
Napoleon's vitals was indeed feathered from his own pinions, since
these two, with another of Napoleon's pupils&mdash;Bernadotte, the Crown
Prince of Sweden&mdash;were virtually the council of war. Two of them, the
latter and Moreau, saw the specter of French sovereignty beckoning
them on. They dreamed of the chief magistracy in some shape,
imperial, monarchical, consular, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> presidential, and were
more devoted to their personal interests than to those of the
coalition. In the service of their ambition was formed the plan by
which not only was Napoleon overwhelmed, but the fields of France were
drenched with blood. Under their advice, three great armies were
arrayed: that of the North, in Brandenburg, was composed of Prussians,
Swedes, and a few Russians, its generals being Bülow, Bernadotte, and
Tchernicheff; that of the East was the Prusso-Russian army in Silesia,
now under Blücher, that astounding young cavalryman of seventy, and
Wittgenstein; finally, that of the South was the new Austrian force
under Schwarzenberg, with an adjunct force of Russian troops under
Barclay, and the Russian guard under the Grand Duke Constantine. Bülow
was in and near Berlin with about a hundred and fifty-six thousand
men; Blücher had ninety-five thousand, and, having violated the
armistice, was on August fourteenth already within the neutral zone at
Striegau, before Breslau; the Austro-Russian force of almost two
hundred and fifty thousand was in northern Bohemia, near Melnik;
Bennigsen was in Poland building up a strong reserve. Schwarzenberg,
though commander of the main army, was reduced to virtual impotence by
the presence at his headquarters of all the sovereigns and of Moreau.
Divided counsels spring from diverse interests; there was at the
outset a pitiful caution and inefficiency on the part of the allies,
while at Napoleon's headquarters there was unity of design at least.</p>

<p>Both contestants were apparently under serious misapprehensions. The
allies certainly were, because Francis believed that, as so often
before, Napoleon's goal would be Vienna. The plan adopted by them was
therefore very simple: each division of the allied army was to stand
expectant; if assailed it was to yield, draw <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> on the French
columns, and expose their flank or rear to the attacks of the other
two allied armies; then by superior force the invaders were to be
surrounded. The allies divined, or believed they divined, that
Napoleon would hold his guard in reserve, throw it behind any portion
of his line opposite which they were vulnerable, break through, and
defeat them in detachments. Their idea was keen, and displayed a
thorough grasp both of the principles on which their opponent had
hitherto acted and of his normal character. But nevertheless they were
deceived. Napoleon discarded all his old principles, and behaved most
abnormally. In his conduct there are evidences of a curious
self-deception, and his decisions contradicted his language.
Perpetually minimizing in conversation the disparity between the two
forces, and sometimes even asserting his own superiority, he
nevertheless almost for the first time assumed the defensive. This
unheard-of course may have been due to misapprehension and
exaggeration, but it produced for the moment a powerful moral effect
on his generals, who, without exception, had hitherto been clamorous
for peace, and likewise upon his new boy recruits; both classes began
to have a realizing sense that they were now fighting, not for
aggression, but for life. If the Emperor had any such confidence as he
expressed, it must have been due to the fact that boys had fought like
veterans at Lützen and Bautzen, and that at last there were cavalry
and artillery in fair proportion. Possibly, likewise, he may have been
desperate; fully aware that he was about to cast the dice for a last
stake, he may have been at once braggart and timid. If he should win
in a common defensive battle, he believed, as his subsequent conduct
goes to show, that he was safe indefinitely; and if he lost&mdash;the
vision must have been too dreadful, enough to distract the sanest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> mind: an exhausted treasury, an exhausted nation, an empty
throne, vanished hopes, ruin!</p>

<p>Yet at the time no one remarked any trace of nervousness in Napoleon.
Long afterward the traitorous Marmont, whose name, like that of
Moreau, was to be execrated by succeeding generations of honorable
Frenchmen, recalled that the Emperor had contemptuously designated the
enemy as a rabble, and that he had likewise overestimated the
strategic value of Berlin. The malignant annalist asserted, too, that
Napoleon's motive was personal spite against Prussia. It has also been
studiously emphasized by others that the "children" of Napoleon's army
were perishing like flowers under an untimely frost, forty thousand
French and German boys being in the hospitals; that corruption was
rife in every department of administration; and that the soldiers' pay
was shamefully in arrears. An eye-witness saw Peyrusse, the paymaster,
to whom Napoleon had just handed four thousand francs for a monument
to Duroc, coolly pocket a quarter of the sum, with the remark that
such was the custom. He would be rash indeed who dared to assert that
there was no basis for this criticism. It is true that the
instructions to Davout and Oudinot made light of Bülow's army, and
that Berlin had vastly less strategic value than those instructions
seemed to indicate. But, on the other hand, both generals and men were
sadly in need of self-reliance, and to see their capitals occupied or
endangered had still a tremendous moral effect upon dynastic
sovereigns. As to the defects in his army, Napoleon could not have
been blind; but in all these directions matters had been nearly, if
not quite, as bad in 1809, and a victory had set them all in order.</p>

<p>What nervousness there was existed rather among the allies. Never
before in her history, not even under the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> great Frederick,
had Prussia possessed such an army; the Austrians were well drilled
and well equipped; the Russians were of fair quality, numerous, and
with the reserves from Poland would be a powerful army in themselves.
Yet in spite of their strength, the allies were not really able.
Austria was the head, but her commander, Schwarzenberg, was not even
mediocre, and among her generals there was only one who was
first-rate, namely, Radetzky. Frederick William and Alexander were of
incongruous natures; their alliance was artificial, and in such plans
as they evolved there was an indefiniteness which left to the generals
in their respective forces a large margin for independence. The latter
were quick to take advantage of the chance, and this fact accounts for
the generally lame and feeble beginning of hostilities.</p>

<p>For example, it was through Blücher's wilfulness that the moral
advantage lay with Napoleon in the opening of the struggle. On July
ninth Bernadotte, Frederick William, and the Czar had met at
Trachenberg to lay out a plan of campaign. In this conference, which
first opened Napoleon's eyes to the determination of the allies,
Blücher had secured for himself an independent command. The accession
of Austria rendered the agreement of Trachenberg null, but Blücher did
not abandon his ambition. Impatient of orders or good faith, he broke
into the neutral zone at Striegau on August fourteenth, apparently
without any very definite plan. Napoleon, hearing that forty thousand
Russians from this army were marching toward Bohemia, advanced from
Dresden on August fifteenth, to be within reach of the passes of the
Iser Mountains on the Upper Elbe, and halted at Zittau as a central
point, where he could easily collect about a hundred and eighty
thousand men, and whence, according to circumstances, he could either
strike Blücher, cut off the Russians, or return to Dresden <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span>
in case of need. That city was to be held by Saint-Cyr. On August
twentieth Blücher reached the banks of the Bober at Bunzlau; owing to
Napoleon's nice calculation, Ney, Marmont, Lauriston, and Macdonald
were assembled on the other side to check the advance, he himself
being at Lauban with the guard. Had Blücher stood, the Russo-Prussians
would have been annihilated, for their inferiority was as two to one.
But the headstrong general did not stand; on the contrary, retreating
by preconcerted arrangement behind the Deichsel, he led his antagonist
to the false conclusion that he lacked confidence in his army.</p>

<p>Napoleon was not generally over-credulous, but this mistake was
probably engendered in his mind by the steady stream of uneasy reports
he was receiving from his own generals. On the twenty-third he wrote
to Maret that his division commanders seemed to have no self-reliance
except in his presence; "the enemy's strength seems great to them
wherever I am not." Marmont was the chief offender, having severely
criticized a plan of operations which would require one or more of the
marshals to act independently in Brandenburg or Silesia or both,
expressing the fear that on the day when the Emperor believed himself
to have won a decisive battle he would discover that he had lost two.
Seventeen years of campaigning had apparently turned the great
generals of Napoleon's army into puppets, capable of acting only on
their leader's impulse. Whatever the cause, Napoleon was set in his
idea, and pressed on in pursuit. On the twenty-second Blücher was
beyond the Katzbach, with the French van close behind, when word
arrived at Napoleon's headquarters that the Austro-Russians had
entered Saxony and were menacing Dresden. How alert and sane the
Emperor was, how thoroughly he foresaw every contingency, appears
from the minute directions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> he wrote for Macdonald, who was
left to block the road for Blücher into Saxony, while Lauriston was to
outflank and shut off the perfervid veteran from both Berlin and
Zittau.</p>

<p>These instructions having been written, Napoleon at first contemplated
crossing the Elbe above Dresden to take Schwarzenberg on the flank and
rear in the passes of the Ore Mountains. This would not only cut off
the Austrian general from the Saxon capital, but prevent his swerving
to the left for an advance on Leipsic. But finding that his enemy was
moving swiftly, the Emperor resolved to meet him before Dresden. It
would never do to lose his ally's capital at the outset, or to suffer
defeat at the very head of his defensive line. Giving orders,
therefore, for the corps of Marmont, Vandamme, and Victor, together
with Latour-Maubourg's cavalry and the guard, to wheel, he hastened
back to reinforce Saint-Cyr at Dresden. On the twenty-fifth, as he
passed Bautzen, he learned that Oudinot had been defeated at Luckau;
but he gave no heed to the report, and next day reached Dresden at
nine in the morning. An hour later the guard came up, having performed
the almost incredible feat of marching seventy-six miles in three
days. Vandamme, with forty thousand men, had arrived at Pirna, a few
miles above, and Saint-Cyr was drawing in behind the temporary
fortifications of the city itself.</p>

<p>The enemy, too, was at hand, but he had no plan. In a council of war
held by him the same morning there was protracted debate, and finally
Moreau's advice to advance in six columns was taken. He refused "to
fight against his country," but explained that the French could never
be conquered in mass, and that if one assailing column were crushed,
the rest could still push on. This long deliberation cost the allies
their opportunity; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> for at four in the afternoon, when they
attacked, the mass of the French army had crossed the Elbe and had
thus completed the garrison of the city. For two hours the fighting
was fierce and stubborn; from three different sides Russians,
Austrians, and Prussians each made substantial gains; at six Napoleon
determined to make a general sally and throw in his guard. With fine
promptness. Mortier, at the head of two divisions of the young guard,
attacked the Russians, and, fighting until midnight, drove them beyond
the hamlet of Striefen. Saint-Cyr dislodged the Prussians, and pushed
them to Strehla; while Ney, with two divisions of the young guard,
threw a portion of the Austrians into Plauen, and Murat, with two
divisions of infantry and Latour-Maubourg's cavalry, cleared the
suburb Friedrichstadt of the rest. Napoleon, alert and ubiquitous,
then made his usual round, and knew when he retired to rest in the
royal palace that with seventy thousand men, or rather boys, he had
repulsed a hundred and fifty thousand of his foe. His inspiriting
personal work might be calculated as worth eighty thousand of his
opponents' best men. That night both Marmont and Victor, with their
corps, entered the city; and Vandamme in the early dawn began to
bombard Pirna, thus threatening the allies' connection with Bohemia
and drawing away forces from them to hold that outpost.</p>

<p>The second day's fighting was more disastrous to the allies than the
first. The morning opened in a tempest, but at six both sides were
arrayed. On the French right were Victor and Latour-Maubourg; then
Marmont; then the old guard and Ney with two divisions of the young
guard; next Saint-Cyr, with Mortier on the left. Opposite stood
Russians, Prussians, and Austrians, in the same relative positions, on
higher ground, encircling the French all the way westward and around
by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> south to Plauen; but between their center and left was
reserved a gap for Klenau's Austrians, who were coming up from
Tharandt in the blinding storm, and were overdue. At seven began the
artillery fire of the young guard; but before long it ceased for an
instant, since the gunners found the enemy's line too high for the
elevation of their guns. "Continue," came swiftly the Emperor's order;
"we must occupy the attention of the enemy on that spot." The ruse
succeeded, and the gap was left open; at ten Murat dashed through it,
and turning westward, killed or captured all who composed the enemy's
extreme left. The garrison of Pirna then retreated toward Peterswald.
Elsewhere the French merely held their own. Napoleon lounged all day
in a curious apathy before his camp-fire, his condition being
apparently due to the incipient stages of a digestive disorder. Early
in the afternoon Schwarzenberg heard of Murat's great charge, but he
held firm until at five the flight from Pirna was announced, when he
abandoned the conflict. By six Napoleon was aware that the battle was
over, and, mounting his horse, he trotted listlessly to the palace,
his old gray overcoat and hood streaming with rain.</p>

<p>Throughout the night after the victory at Dresden, Napoleon believed
that the enemy would return again to battle on the morrow. This is
conclusively shown by the notes which he made for Berthier during the
evening. These were based on the stated hypothesis that the enemy was
not really in retreat, but would on the morrow by a great battle
strive to retrieve his failure. But the Emperor was altogether
mistaken. To be sure, the council of the disheartened allies debated
far into the small hours whether an advantageous stand could not still
be made on the heights of Dippoldiswalde, but the decision was adverse
because the coalition army was sadly shattered, having lost a third of
its numbers. Crippled on its left and threatened on its rear, it
began <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> next morning to retreat in fair order toward the Ore
Mountains, and so continued until it became known that Vandamme was
directly in the path, when a large proportion of the troops literally
took to the hills, and retreat became flight. Then first, at four in
the afternoon, Napoleon began to realize what had actually occurred.
And what did he do? Having ridden almost to Pirna before taking
measures of any kind to reap the fruits of victory, he there issued
orders for the single corps of Vandamme, slightly reinforced, to begin
the pursuit! Thereupon, leaving directions for Mortier to hold Pirna,
he entered a carriage and drove quietly back to Dresden!</p>

<p>These are the almost incredible facts: no terrific onslaught after the
first night, no well-ordered pursuit after the second, a mere pretense
of seizing the advantage on the third day! In fact, Napoleon, having
set his plan in operation at the very beginning of the battle, sank,
to all outward appearances, into a state of lassitude, the only sign
of alert interest he displayed throughout the conflict being shown
when he was told that Moreau had been mortally wounded. The cause may
have been physical or it may have been moral, but it was probably a
political miscalculation. If we may believe Captain Coignet, the talk
of the staff on the night of the twenty-seventh revealed a perfect
knowledge of the enemy's rout; they knew that the retreat of their
opponents had been precipitate, and they had credible information of
disordered bands seen hurrying through byways or rushing headlong
through mountain defiles. Yet for all this, they were thoroughly
discontented, and the burden of their conversation was execration of
the Emperor. "He's a &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; who will ruin us all," was the repeated
malediction. If we may believe Napoleon himself, he had a violent
attack of vomiting near Pirna, and was compelled to leave everything
on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> that fateful day to others. This is possible, but
unlikely; the day before, though listless, he was well enough to chat
and take snuff as he stood in a redoubt observing the course of events
through his field-glass; the day after he was perfectly well, and
exercised unusual self-control when tidings of serious import were
brought from the north. The sequel goes to show that neither his own
sickness nor the bad temper of the army sufficiently accounts for
Napoleon's unmilitary conduct on the twenty-eighth; it appears, on the
contrary, as if he refrained of set purpose from annihilating the
Austrian army in order to reknit the Austrian alliance and destroy the
coalition. This he never was willing to admit; but no man likes to
confess himself a dupe.</p>

<p>Had Oudinot and Macdonald succeeded in their offensive operations
against Berlin, and had Napoleon himself done nothing more than hold
Dresden, a place which we must remember he considered from the outset
as a defensive point, it would have sufficed, in order to obtain the
most favorable terms of peace, to throw back the main army of the
coalition, humiliated and dispirited, through Bohemia to Prague. But,
as we have repeatedly seen, long service under the Empire had
destroyed all initiative in the French marshals: in Spain one mighty
general after another had been brought low; those who were serving in
Germany seemed stricken with the same palsy. It is true that in the
days of their greatness they had commanded choice troops, and that now
the flower of the army was reserved for the Emperor; but it is
likewise true that then they had fought for wealth, advancement, and
power. Now they yearned to enjoy their gains, and were embittered
because Napoleon had not accepted Austria's terms of mediation until
it was too late. Moreover, Bernadotte, one of their opponents, had
been trained in their own school, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> and was fighting for a
crown. To Blücher, untamed and untrustworthy in temper, had been given
in the person of Gneisenau an efficient check on all headlong
impulses, and Bülow was a commander far above mediocrity. Such
considerations go far to account for three disasters&mdash;those, namely,
of Grossbeeren, Katzbach, and Kulm&mdash;which made it insufficient for
Napoleon to hold Dresden and throw back the main army of the allies,
and which thwarted all his strategy, military and political.</p>

<p>The first of these affairs was scarcely a defeat. Oudinot, advancing
with seventy thousand men by way of Wittenberg to seize Berlin, found
himself confronted by Bernadotte with eighty thousand. The latter,
with his eye on the crown of France, naturally feared to defeat a
French army; at first he thought of retreating across the Spree and
abandoning the Prussian capital. But the Prussians were outraged at
the possibility of such conduct, and the schemer was convinced that a
show of resistance was imperative. On August twenty-second a few
skirmishes occurred, and the next day Bülow, disobeying his orders,
brought on a pitched battle at Grossbeeren, which was waged, with
varying success, until nightfall left the village in French hands.
Oudinot, however, discouraged alike by the superior force of the
enemy, by the obstinate courage of the Prussians, and by the dismal
weather, lost heart, and retreated to Wittenberg. The heavy rains
prevented an effective pursuit, but the Prussians followed as far as
Treuenbrietzen. On August twenty-first, Blücher, aware of the
circumstances which kept Napoleon at Dresden, had finally determined
to attack Macdonald. The French marshal, by a strange coincidence,
almost simultaneously abandoned the defensive position he had been
ordered to hold, and advanced to give battle. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span> It was
therefore a mere chance when on the twenty-fifth the two armies came
together, amid rain and fog, at the Katzbach. After a bitter struggle
the French were routed with frightful loss. A terrific rain-storm set
in, and the whole country was turned into a marsh. For five days
Blücher continued the pursuit, until he reached Naumburg, on the right
bank of the Queiss, where he halted, having captured eighteen thousand
prisoners and a hundred and three guns.</p>

<p>To these misfortunes the affair at Kulm was a fitting climax. No worse
leader for a delicate independent movement could have been selected
than the reckless Vandamme. He was so rash, conceited, and brutish
that Napoleon once exclaimed in sheer desperation: "If there were two
Vandammes in my army, nothing could be done until one had killed the
other." As might have been expected, the headlong general far
outstripped the columns of Marmont, Saint-Cyr, and Murat, which had
been tardily sent to support him. Descending without circumspection
into the plain of Kulm, he found himself, on the twenty-ninth,
confronted by the Russian guard; and next morning, when attacked by
them in superior force, he was compelled to retreat through a mountain
defile toward Peterswald, whence he had come. At the mouth of the
gorge he was unexpectedly met by the Prussian corps of Kleist. Each
side thought the other moving to cut it off. They therefore rushed one
upon the other in despair, with no other hope than that of breaking
through to rejoin their respective armies. The shock was terrible, and
for a time the confusion seemed inextricable. But the Russians soon
came up, and Vandamme, with seven thousand men, was captured, the loss
in slain and wounded being about five thousand. Saint-Cyr, Marmont,
and Murat halted and held the mountain passes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> This was the climax of disaster in Napoleon's great strategic
plan. In no way responsible for Grossbeeren, nor for Macdonald's
defeat on the Katzbach, he was culpable both for the selection of
Vandamme and for failure to support him in the pursuit of
Schwarzenberg. At St. Helena the Emperor strove in three ways to
account for the crash under which he was buried after Dresden: by the
sickness which made him unable to give attention to the situation, by
the inundation which rendered Macdonald helpless at the crossing of
the Bober, and by the arrival of a notification from the King of
Bavaria that, after a certain date, he too would join the coalition.
This was not history, but an appeal to public sentiment, carefully
calculated for untrained readers.</p>

<p>The fact was that at Dresden the gradual transformation of the
strategist into the politician, which had long been going on, was
complete. The latter misapprehended the moment for diplomatic
negotiations, conceiving the former's victory to have been
determinative, when in reality it was rendered partial and contingent
by failure to follow it up. Great as Napoleon was in other respects,
he was supremely great as a strategist; it is therefore his
psychological development and decline in this respect which are
essential to the determination of the moment in which he became
bankrupt in ability. This instant was that of course in which his
strategic failures became no longer intermittent, but regular; and
after Dresden such was the case. As to conception and tactics there
never was a failure&mdash;the year 1814 is the wonder-year of his
theoretical genius; but after Dresden there is continuous failure in
the practical combination of concept and means, in other words, of
strategic mastery. This contention as to the clouding of Napoleon's
vision by the interference of political and military considerations
is proved by his next step. Hitherto <span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> his basal principle had
been to mass all his force for a determinative blow, his combinations
all turning about hostile armies and their annihilation, or at least
about producing situations which would make annihilation possible. Now
he was concerned, not with armies, but with capital cities. Claiming
that to extend his line toward Prague would weaken it, in order to
resume a strong defensive he chose the old plan of an advance to
Berlin, and Ney was sent to supersede Oudinot, Schwarzenberg being
left to recuperate unmolested. The inchoate idea of political victory
which turned him back from Pirna was fully developed; by a blow at
Berlin and a general northward movement he could not merely punish
Prussia, but alarm Russia, separate the latter's army from that of the
other allies, and then plead with Austria his consideration in not
invading her territories. In spite of all that has been written to the
contrary, there was some strength in this idea, unworthy as it was of
the author's strategic ability. Ney was to advance immediately, while
he himself pressed on to Hoyerswerda, where he hoped to establish
connections for a common advance.</p>

<p>Such a concentration would have been possible if for a fortnight
Macdonald had been able to hold Blücher, and Murat had succeeded in
checking Schwarzenberg. But the news of Macdonald's plight compelled
Napoleon to march first toward Bautzen, in order to prevent Blücher
from annihilating the army in Silesia. Exasperated by this unexpected
diversion, the Emperor started in a reckless, embittered temper. On
September fifth it became evident that Blücher would not stand, and
Napoleon prepared to wheel in the direction of Berlin; but the orders
were almost immediately recalled, for news arrived that Schwarzenberg
was marching to Dresden. At once Napoleon returned to the Saxon
capital. By September tenth he had drawn in his forces, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span>
ready for a second defense of the city; but learning that sixty
thousand Austrians had been sent over the Elbe to take on its flank
any French army sent after Blücher, he ordered the young guard to
Bautzen for the reinforcement of Macdonald. Thereupon Schwarzenberg,
on the fourteenth, made a feint to advance. On the fifteenth Napoleon
replied by a countermove on Pirna, where pontoons were thrown over the
river to establish connection with Macdonald. On the sixteenth
Napoleon reconnoitered, on the seventeenth there was a skirmish, and
on the eighteenth there were again a push and counterpush. These
movements convinced Napoleon that Schwarzenberg was really on the
defensive, and he returned to Dresden, determined to let feint and
counter-feint, the "system of hither and thither," as he called it, go
on until the golden opportunity for a crushing blow should be offered.
Blücher meantime had turned again on Macdonald, who was now on the
heights of Fischbach with Poniatowski on his right. Mortier was again
at Pirna; Victor, Saint-Cyr, and Lobau were guarding the mountain
passes from Bohemia.</p>

<p>This was virtually the situation of a month previous to the battle.
Schwarzenberg might feel that he had prevented the invasion of
Austria; Napoleon, that he had regained his strong defensive. While
the victory of Dresden had gone for nothing, yet this situation was
nevertheless a double triumph for Napoleon. Ney, in obedience to
orders, had advanced on the fifth. Bernadotte lay at Jüterbog, his
right being westerly at Dennewitz, under Tauenzien. Bertrand was to
make a demonstration on the sixth against the latter, so that behind
this movement the rest of the army should pass by unnoticed. But Ney
started three hours late, so that the skirmish between Tauenzien and
Bertrand lasted long enough to give the alarm to Bülow, who hurried
in, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> attacked Reynier's division, and turned the affair into a
general engagement. At first the advantage was with the Prussians;
then Ney, at an opportune moment, began to throw in Oudinot's corps&mdash;a
move which seemed likely to decide the struggle in favor of the
French. But Borstell, who had been Bülow's lieutenant at Grossbeeren,
brought up his men in disobedience to Bernadotte's orders, and threw
them into the thickest of the conflict. Hitherto the Saxons had been
fighting gallantly on the French side; soon they began to waver, and
now, falling back, they took up many of Oudinot's men in their flight.
The Prussians poured into the gap left by the Saxons, and when
Bernadotte came up with his Swedes and Russians the battle was over.
Ney was driven into Torgau, with a loss of fifteen thousand men,
besides eighty guns and four hundred train-wagons. The Prussians lost
about nine thousand killed and wounded.</p>

<p>This affair concentrated into one movement the moral effects of all
the minor defeats, an influence which far outweighed the importance of
Dresden. The French still fought superbly in Napoleon's presence, but
only then, for they were heartily sick of the war. Nor was this all:
the Bavarians and Saxons were coming to feel that their obligations to
France had been fully discharged. They were infected with the same
national spirit which made heroes of the Prussians. These, to be sure,
were defending their homes and firesides; but seeing the great French
generals successively defeated, and that largely by their own efforts,
they were animated to fresh exertions by their victories; even the
reserves and the home guard displayed the heroism of veterans. On
September seventh Ney wrote to Napoleon: "Your left flank is
exhausted&mdash;take heed; I think it is time to leave the Elbe and
withdraw to the Saale"; and his opinion was that of all the division
commanders. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span> Throughout the country-side partizans were
seizing the supply-trains; Davout had found his Dutch and Flemings to
be mediocre soldiers, unfit at crucial moments to take the offensive;
the army had shrunk to about two hundred and fifty thousand men all
told; straggling was increasing, and the country was virtually
devastated. To this last fact the plain people, sufferers as they
were, remained in their larger patriotism amazingly indifferent: the
"hither-and-thither" system tickled their fancy, and they dubbed
Napoleon the "Bautzen Messenger-boy." Uneasiness pervaded every French
encampment; on the other side timidity was replaced by courage,
dissension by unity.</p>

<p>This transformation of German society seemed further to entangle the
political threads which had already debased the quality of Napoleon's
strategy. Technically no fault can be found with his prompt changes of
plan to meet emergencies, or with the details of movements which led
to his prolonged inaction. Yet, largely considered, the result was
disastrous. The great medical specialist refrains from the immediate
treatment of a sickly organ until the general health is sufficiently
recuperated to assure success; the medicaster makes a direct attack on
evident disease. Napoleon conceived a great general plan for
concentrating about Dresden to recuperate his forces; but when Blücher
prepared to advance he grew impatient, saw only his immediate trouble,
and ordered Macdonald to make a grand dash. Driving in the hostile
outposts to Förstgen, he then spent a whole day hesitating whether to
go on or to turn westward and disperse another detachment of his
ubiquitous foe, which, as he heard from Ney, had bridged the Elbe at
the mouth of the Black Elster. It was the twenty-third before he
turned back to do neither, but to secure needed rest on the left bank
of the Elbe. But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span> if Napoleon's own definition of a truly
great man be accurate,&mdash;namely, one who can command the situations he
creates,&mdash;he was himself no longer great. The enemy not only had
bridges over the Elbe at the mouth of the Elster, but at Acken and
Rosslau. The left bank was as untenable for the French as the right,
and it was of stern necessity that the various detachments of the army
were called in to hold a line far westward, to the north of Leipsic.
Oudinot, restored to partial favor, was left to keep the rear at
Dresden with part of the young guard. On October first it was learned
that Schwarzenberg was man&oelig;uvering on the left to surround the
invaders if possible by the south, and that Blücher, with like aim,
was moving to the north. It was evident that the allies had formed a
great resolution, and Napoleon confessed to Marmont that his "game of
chess was becoming confused."</p>

<p>The fact was, the Emperor's diplomacy had far outstripped the
general's strategy. It was blazoned abroad that on September
twenty-seventh a hundred and sixty thousand new conscripts from the
class of 1815, with a hundred and twenty thousand from the arrears of
the seven previous classes, would be assembled at the military depots
in France. Boys like these had won Lützen, Bautzen, and Dresden, and a
large minority would be able-bodied men, late in maturing, perhaps,
but strong. With this preliminary blare of trumpets, a letter for the
Emperor Francis was sent to General Bubna. The bearer was instructed
to say that Napoleon would make great sacrifices both for Austria and
Prussia if only he could get a hearing. It was too late: already, on
September ninth, the three powers had concluded an offensive and
defensive alliance for the purpose of liberating the Rhenish princes,
of making sovereign and independent the states of southern and
western Germany, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> and of restoring both Prussia and Austria to
their limits of 1805. This was the treaty which beguiled Bavaria from
the French alliance, and made the German contingents in the French
armies, the Saxons among the rest, wild for emancipation from a hated
service. It explained the notification previously received from the
King of Bavaria, who, in return for the recognition of his complete
autonomy, formally joined the coalition on October eighth, with an
army of thirty-six thousand men. How much of all this the French spies
and emissaries made known to Napoleon does not appear. One thing only
is certain, that Napoleon's flag of truce was sent back with his
message undelivered. This ominous fact had to be considered in
connection with the movements of the enemy. They had learned one of
Napoleon's own secrets. In a bulletin of 1805 are the words: "It rains
hard, but that does not stop the march of the grand army." In 1806 he
boasted concerning Prussia: "While people are deliberating, the French
army is marching." In 1813, while he himself was vacillating, his foes
were stirring. On October third, Blücher, having accomplished a superb
strategic march, drove Bertrand to Bitterfeld, and stood before
Kemberg, west of the Elbe, with sixty-four thousand men; Bernadotte,
with eighty thousand, was crossing at Acken and Rosslau; and
Schwarzenberg, with a hundred and seventy thousand, was already south
of Leipsic; Bennigsen, with fifty thousand reserves, had reached
Teplitz. The enemy would clearly concentrate at Leipsic and cut off
Napoleon's base unless he retreated. But it was October fifth before
the bitter resolution to do so was taken, and then the movement began
under compulsion. Murat was sent, with three infantry corps and one of
cavalry, to hold Schwarzenberg until the necessary man&oelig;uvers could
be completed.</p>

<h4>The End of the Grand Army<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3"><span class="smaller">[3]</span></a></h4>

<p class="summary">Plans for Conducting the Retreat &mdash; Napoleon's Health &mdash;
     Blücher's Brilliant Idea &mdash; Napoleon under Compulsion &mdash; His
     Skilful Concentration &mdash; The Battle-field around Leipsic &mdash; The

     &mdash; Dissolution of the Grand Army.</p>

<p>But how should the retreat be conducted? Napoleon's habit of reducing
his thoughts to writing for the sake of clearness remained strong upon
him to the last, and in the painstaking notes which he made with
regard to this important move he outlined two alternatives: to
garrison Dresden with two corps, send three to reconnoiter about
Chemnitz, and then march, with five and the guard, to attack
Schwarzenberg; or else to strengthen Murat, place him between
Schwarzenberg and Leipsic, and then advance to drive Bernadotte and
Blücher behind the Elbe. But in winter the frozen Elbe with its flat
shores would be no rampart. Both plans were abandoned, and on the
seventh orders were issued for a retreat behind the Saale, the
precipitous banks of which were a natural fortification. Behind this
line of defense he could rest in safety during the winter, with his
right at Erfurt and his left at Magdeburg. Dresden must, he
concluded, be evacuated. This would deprive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> the allies of the
easy refuge behind the Saxon and Bohemian mountains which they had
sought at every onset, but it might leave them complete masters of
Saxony. To avoid this he must take one of three courses: either halt
behind the Mulde for one blow at the armies of the North and of
Silesia, or join Murat for a decisive battle with the Austrian
general, or else concentrate at Leipsic, and meet the onset of the
united allies, now much stronger than he was.</p>

<p>The night of the seventh was spent in indecision as to any one or all
of these ideas, but in active preparation for the actual movements of
the retreat, however it should be conducted; any contingency might be
met or a resolve taken when the necessity arose. During that night the
Emperor took two warm baths. The habit of drinking strong coffee to
prevent drowsiness had induced attacks of nervousness, and these were
not diminished by his load of care. To allay these and other ailments,
he had had recourse for some time to frequent tepid baths. Much has
been written about a mysterious malady which had been steadily
increasing, but the burden of testimony from the Emperor's closest
associates at this time indicates that in the main he had enjoyed
excellent health throughout the second Saxon campaign. He was, on the
whole, calm and self-reliant, exhibiting signs of profound emotion
only in connection with important decisions. He was certainly capable
of clear insight and of severe application in a crisis; he could still
endure exhausting physical exertion, and rode without discomfort,
sitting his horse in the same stiff, awkward manner as of old. There
were certainly intervals of self-indulgence and of lassitude, of
excessive emotion and depressing self-examination, which seemed to
require the offset of a physical stimulus; but on the whole there do
not appear to have been such sharp attacks of illness, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> or
even of morbid depression, as amount to providential interference;
natural causes, complex but not inexplicable, sufficiently account for
the subsequent disasters.</p>

<p>For instance, considerations of personal friendship having in earlier
days often led him to unwise decisions, a like cause may be said to
have brought on his coming disaster. It was the affection of the Saxon
king for his beautiful capital which at the very last instant, on
October eighth, induced Napoleon to cast all his well-weighed scheme
to the winds, and&mdash;fatal decision!&mdash;leave Saint-Cyr and Lobau, with
three corps, in Dresden. A decisive battle was imminent; the commander
was untrue to his maxim that every division should be under the
colors. But with or without his full force, the master-strategist was
outwitted: the expected meeting did not take place as he finally
reckoned. On the tenth his headquarters were at Düben, and his
divisions well forward on the Elbe, ready for Bernadotte and Blücher;
but there was no foe. Both these generals had been disconcerted by the
unexpected swiftness of the French movements; the former actually
contemplated recrossing the river to avoid a pitched battle with those
whom he hoped before long to secure as his subjects. But the
enthusiastic old Prussian shamed his ally into action, persuading him
at least to march south from Acken, effect a junction with the army of
Silesia, and cross the Saale to threaten Napoleon from the rear. This
was a brilliant and daring plan, for if successful both armies might
possibly unite with Schwarzenberg's; but even if unsuccessful in that,
they would at least reproduce the situation in Silesia, and reduce the
French to the "hither-and-thither" system, which, rendering a decisive
battle impossible, had thwarted the Napoleonic strategy.</p>

<p>Napoleon spent a weary day of waiting in Düben, yawning and
scribbling, but keeping his geographer and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> secretary in
readiness. It was said at the time, and has since been repeated, that
throughout this portion of the campaign Napoleon was not recognizable
as himself: that he ruminated long when he should have been active;
that he consulted when he should have given orders; that he was no
longer ubiquitous as of old, but sluggish, and rooted to one spot. But
it is hard to see what he left undone, his judgment being mistaken as
it was. When rumors of Bernadotte's movements began to arrive, he
dismissed the idea suggested by them as preposterous; when finally, on
the twelfth, he heard that Blücher was actually advancing to Halle,
and no possible doubt remained, he gave instant orders for a march on
Leipsic. Critics have suggested that again delay had been his ruin;
but this is not true. An advance over the Elbe toward Berlin in search
of the enemy would merely have enabled Blücher and Bernadotte to join
forces sooner, and have rendered their union with Schwarzenberg
easier. No stricture is just but one: that Napoleon, knowing how
impossible it was to obtain such exact information as he seemed
determined to have, should have divined the enemy's plan, and acted
sooner. The accurate information necessary for such foresight was not
obtainable; in fact, it seldom is, and some allowance may be made if
the general lingered before rushing into the "tube of a funnel," as
Marmont expressed it. On the morning of the thirteenth, while the
final arrangements for marching to Leipsic were making, came the news
of Bavaria's defection. It spread throughout the army like wildfire,
but its effect was less than might be imagined, and it served for the
priming of a bulletin, issued on the fifteenth, announcing the
approaching battle.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth, Murat, who had been steadily withdrawing before the
allied army of the South, was overtaken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> at Wachau by
Schwarzenberg's van. He fought all day with magnificent courage, and
successfully, hurling the hostile cavalry skirmishers back on the main
column. Within sound of his guns, Napoleon was reconnoitering his
chosen battle-field in and about Leipsic; and when, after nightfall,
the brothers-in-law met, the necessary arrangements were virtually
complete. Those who were present at the council thought the Emperor
inexplicably calm and composed&mdash;they said indifferent or stolid. But
he had reasons to be confident rather than desperate, for by a touch
of his old energy he had concentrated more swiftly than his foe,
having a hundred and seventy thousand men in array. Reynier, with
fourteen thousand more, was near; if Saint-Cyr and Lobau, with their
thirty thousand, had been present instead of sitting idly in Dresden,
the French would actually have outnumbered any army the coalition
could have assembled for battle. The allies could hope at best to
produce two hundred thousand men; Bernadotte was still near Merseburg;
Blücher, though coming in from Halle, was not within striking
distance. In spite of his vacillation and final failure to evacuate
Dresden, Napoleon had an excellent fighting chance.</p>

<p>The city of Leipsic, engirdled by numerous villages, lies in a low
plain watered by the Parthe, Pleisse, and Elster, the last of which to
the westward has several arms, with swampy banks. Across these runs
the highway to Frankfort, elevated on a dike, and spanning the deep,
central stream of the Elster by a single bridge. Eastward by Connewitz
the land is higher, there being considerable swells, and even hills,
to the south and southeast. This rolling country was that chosen by
Napoleon for the main battle against Schwarzenberg; Marmont was
stationed north of the city, near Möckern, to observe Blücher;
Bernadotte, the cautious, was still <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> at Oppin with his Swedes.
On the evening of the fifteenth, his dispositions being complete,
Napoleon made the tour of all his posts. At dusk three white rockets
were seen to rise in the southern sky; they were promptly answered by
four red ones in the north. These were probably signals between
Schwarzenberg and Blücher. Napoleon's watch-fire was kindled behind
the old guard, between Reudnitz and Crottendorf.</p>

<p>The battle began early next morning. Napoleon waited until nine, and
then advanced at the head of his guards to Liebertwolkwitz, near
Wachau, on the right bank of the Pleisse, where the decisive struggle
was sure to occur, since the mass of the enemy, under Barclay, with
Wittgenstein as second in command, had attacked in four columns at
that point. Between the Pleisse and the Elster, near Connewitz, stood
Poniatowski, opposed to Schwarzenberg and Meerveldt; westward of the
Elster, near Lindenau, stood Bertrand, covering the single line of
retreat, the Frankfort highway, and his antagonist was Gyulay. Thus
there were four divisions in the mighty conflict, which began by an
onset of the allies along the entire front. The main engagement was
stubborn and bloody, the allies attacking with little skill, but great
bravery. Until near midday Napoleon more than held his own. Victor at
Wachau, and Lauriston at Liebertwolkwitz, had each successfully
resisted six desperate assaults; between them were massed the
artillery, a hundred and fifty guns, under Drouot, and behind, all the
cavalry except that of Sebastiani. The great artillery captain was
about to give the last splendid exhibition of what his arm can do
under favorable circumstances&mdash;that is, when strongly posted in the
right position and powerfully supported by cavalry. He intended, with
an awful shock and swift pursuit, to break through the enemy's center
at Güldengossa and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span> surround his right. So great was his
genius for combinations that while the allies were that moment using
three hundred and twenty-five thousand effective men all told to his
two hundred and fourteen thousand, yet in the decisive spot he had
actually concentrated a hundred and fifteen thousand to their hundred
and fourteen thousand. This was because Schwarzenberg, having
attempted to outflank the French, was floundering to no avail in the
swampy meadows between the Pleisse and the Elster, and was no longer a
factor in the contest.</p>

<p>When, at midday, all was in readiness and the order was given, the
artillery fire was so rapid that the successive shots were heard, not
separately, but in a long, sullen note. By two, Victor and Oudinot on
the right, with Mortier and Macdonald on the left, were well forward
of Güldengossa, but the place itself still held out. At three the
cavalry, under Murat, Latour-Maubourg, and Kellermann, were sped
direct upon it. With awful effort they broke through, and the bells of
Leipsic began to ring in triumph&mdash;prematurely. The Czar had
peremptorily summoned from Schwarzenberg's command the Austro-Russian
reserve, and at four these, with the Cossack guard, charged the French
cavalry, hurling them back to Markkleeberg. Nightfall found Victor
again at Wachau, and Macdonald holding Liebertwolkwitz. Simultaneously
with the great charge of the allies Meerveldt had dashed out from
Connewitz toward Dölitz, but his force was nearly annihilated, and he
himself was captured. At Möckern, Marmont, after gallant work with
inferior numbers, had been beaten on his left, and then compelled for
safety to draw in his right. While he still held Gohlis and
Eutritzsch, the mass of his army had been thrown back into Leipsic.
Throughout the day Bertrand made a gallant and successful resistance
to superior numbers, and drove that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> portion of the allied
forces opposed to him away from Lindenau as far as Plagwitz. At
nightfall three blank shots announced the cessation of hostilities all
around.</p>

<p>In the face of superior numbers, the French had not lost a single
important position, and whatever military science had been displayed
was all theirs; Blücher made the solitary advance move of the allies,
the seizure of Möckern by York's corps; Schwarzenberg had been
literally mired in his attempt to outflank his enemy, and but for
Alexander's peremptory recall of the reserves destined for the same
task, the day would have been one of irretrievable disaster to the
coalition. Yet Napoleon knew that he was lost unless he could retreat.
Clearly he had expected a triumph, for in the city nothing was ready,
and over the Elster was but one crossing, the solitary bridge on the
Frankfort road. The seventeenth was the first day of the week; both
sides were exhausted, and the Emperor of the French seems to have felt
that at all hazards he must gain time. During the previous night long
consultations had been held, and the French divisions to the south had
been slightly compacted. In the morning Meerveldt, the captured
Austrian general, the same man who after Austerlitz had solicited and
obtained on the part of Francis an interview from Napoleon, was
paroled, and sent into his own lines to ask an armistice, together
with the intervention of Francis on the terms of Prague: renunciation
of Poland and Illyria by Napoleon, the absolute independence of
Holland, of the Hanse towns, of Spain, and of a united Italy. When we
remember that England was paymaster to the coalition, and was fighting
for her influence in Holland, and that Austria's ambition was for
predominance in a disunited Italy, we feel that apparently Napoleon
wanted time rather than hoped for a successful plea to his
father-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> This would be the inevitable conclusion except for the fact
that he withdrew quietly to his tent and there remained; the
resourceful general was completely apathetic, being either
over-confident in his diplomatic mission or stunned by calamity. The
day passed without incident except a momentary attack on Marmont, and
the arrival of Bernadotte, who had been spurred to movement by a hint
from Gneisenau concerning the terms on which Great Britain was to pay
her subsidies. It was asserted at the time that Napoleon gave orders
early in the morning for building numerous bridges over the western
streams. If so, they were not executed, only a single flimsy structure
being built, and that on the road leading from the town, not on the
lines westward from his positions in the suburbs. His subordinates
should have acted in so serious a matter even without orders; but,
like the drivers of trains which run at lightning speed, they had,
after years of high-pressure service, lost their nerve. Marmont
asserts that even Napoleon was nerveless. "We were occupied," he
wrote, "in restoring order among our troops; we should either have
commenced our retreat, or at least have prepared the means to commence
it at nightfall. But a certain carelessness on the part of Napoleon,
which it is impossible to explain and difficult to describe, filled
the cup of our sorrows." Considering who wrote these words, they must
be taken with allowance; but they indicate a truth, that in his
decadence this hitherto many-sided man could not be both general and
emperor. No answer from Francis was received; the allies agreed on
this course, and determined, according to their agreement with
England, not to cease fighting till the last French soldier was over
the Rhine. It was midnight when Napoleon finally drew in his posts and
gave preliminary orders to dispose his troops in readiness either to
fight or to retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> When day dawned on October eighteenth the French army
occupied an entirely new position: the right wing, under Murat, lying
between Connewitz and Dölitz; the center at Probstheida in a salient
angle; the left, under Ney, with front toward the north between
Paunsdorf and Gohlis. Within this arc, and close about the city, stood
all the well-tried corps, infantry, artillery, and cavalry, under
their various leaders of renown&mdash;Poniatowski, Augereau, Victor,
Drouot, Kellermann, Oudinot, Latour-Maubourg, Macdonald, Marmont,
Reynier, and Souham; Napoleon was on a hillock at Thonberg, with the
old guard in reserve. His chief concern was the line of retreat, which
was still open when, at seven, the fighting began. Schwarzenberg, with
the left, could get no farther than Connewitz. Bennigsen, with the
right, started to feel Bernadotte and complete the investment. Neither
was entirely successful, but Marmont withdrew from before Blücher, and
Ney from before Bernadotte and Bennigsen, in order to avoid being
surrounded; so that the two French armies were united before nightfall
on the western outskirts of the town, where Bertrand had routed
Gyulay, and had kept open the all-important line of retreat, over
which, since noon, trains of wagons had been passing. But magnificent
as was the work of all these doughty champions on both sides, it was
far surpassed in the center, where during the entire day, under
Napoleon's eye, advance and resistance had been desperate. Men fell
like grass before the scythe, and surging lines of their comrades
moved on from behind. Such were the numbers and such the carnage that
men have compared the conflict to that of the nations at Armageddon.</p>

<p>At Victor's stand, near Probstheida, the fighting was fiercer than the
fiercest. The allied troops charged with fixed bayonets, rank after
rank, column following on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> column; cannon roared while
grape-shot and shells sped to meet the assailants; men said the air
was full of human limbs; ten times Russians and Prussians came on,
only to be ten times driven back. The very soil on which the
assailants trod was human flesh. Hour after hour the slaughter
continued. Occasionally the French attempted a rally, but only to be
thrown back by musket fire and cavalry charge. It was the same at
Stötteritz, where no one seemed to pause for breath. Woe to him who
fell in fatigue: he was soon but another corpse in the piles over
which new reinforcements came on to the assault or countercharge. At
last there was scarcely a semblance of order; in hand-to-hand conflict
men shouted, struggled, wrestled, thrust, advanced, and withdrew, and
in neither combatants nor onlookers was there any sense of reality. By
dusk the heated cannon were almost useless, the muskets entirely so,
and, as darkness came down, the survivors fell asleep where they
stood, riders in their saddles, horses in their tracks. Napoleon
learned that thirty-five thousand Saxons on the left had gone over to
the enemy, and some one of his staff handing him a wooden chair, he
dropped into it and sank into a stupor almost as he touched it. For
half an hour he sat in oblivion, while in the thickening darkness the
marshals and generals gathered about the watch-fires, and stood with
sullen mien to abide his awakening. The moon came slowly up, Napoleon
awoke, orders were given to complete the dispositions for retreat
already taken, and, there being nothing left to do, the Emperor, with
inscrutable emotions, passed inside the walls of Leipsic to take
shelter in an inn on the creaking sign-board of which were depicted
the arms of Prussia!</p>

<p>Throughout the night French troops streamed over the stone bridge
across the Elster; in the early morning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> the enemy began to
advance, and ever-increasing numbers hurried away to gain the single
avenue of retreat. Until midday Napoleon wandered aimlessly about the
inner town, giving unimportant commands to stem the ever-growing
confusion and disorder. Haggard, and with his clothing in disarray, he
was not recognized by his own men, being sometimes rudely jostled.
After an affecting farewell to the King of Saxony, in which his
unhappy ally was instructed to make the best terms he could for
himself, the Emperor finally fell into the throng and moved with it
toward Lindenau. Halting near the Elster, a French general began to
seek information from the roughly clad onlooker who, without a suite
or even a single attendant, stood apparently indifferent, softly
whistling, "Malbrook s'en va t'en guerre." Of course the officer
started as he recognized the Emperor, but the conquered sovereign took
no notice. Bystanders thought his heart was turned to stone. Still the
rush of retreat went on, successfully also, in spite of some
confusion, until at two some one blundered. By the incredible mistake
of a French subaltern, as is now proven, the permanent Elster bridge
was blown up, and the temporary one had long since fallen. Almost
simultaneously with this irreparable disaster the allies had stormed
the city, and the French rear-guard came thundering on, hoping to find
safety in flight. Plunging into the deep stream, many, like
Poniatowski, were drowned; some, like the wounded Macdonald, swam
safely across. The scene was heartrending as horses, riders, and
footmen rolled senseless in the dark flood, while others scrambled
over their writhing forms in mad despair. Reynier and Lauriston, with
twenty thousand men, were captured, the King of Saxony was sent a
prisoner to Berlin, and Stein prepared to govern his domains by
commission from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> allies. By ten in the evening Bertrand
was in possession of Weissenfels; Oudinot wheeled at Lindenau, and
held the unready pursuers in check.</p>

<p>Next morning, the twentieth, Napoleon was alert and active; retreat
began again, but only in tolerable order. Although he could not
control the great attendant rabble of camp-followers and stragglers,
he had nevertheless about a hundred and twenty thousand men under his
standards; as many more, and those his finest veterans, were besieged
and held in the fortresses of the Elbe, Oder, and Vistula by local
militia. These places, he knew, would no longer be tenable; in fact,
they began to surrender almost immediately, and the survivors of
Leipsic were soon in a desperate plight from hunger and fatigue. Yet
the commander gave no sign of sensibility. "'T was thus he left
Russia," said the surly men in the ranks. Hunger-typhus appeared, and
spread with awful rapidity; the country swarmed with partizans; the
columns of the allies were behind and on each flank; fifty-six
thousand Bavarians were approaching from Ansbach, under Wrede; at
Erfurt all the Saxons and Bavarians still remaining under the French
eagles marched away. The only foreign troops who kept true were those
who had no country and no refuge, the unhappy Poles, who, though
disappointed in their hopes, were yet faithful to him whom they
wrongly believed to have been their sincere friend. Though stricken by
all his woes, the Emperor was undaunted; the retreat from Germany was
indeed perilous, but it was marked by splendid courage and unsurpassed
skill. At Kösen and at Eisenach the allies were outwitted, and at
Hanau, on the twenty-ninth, the Bavarians were overwhelmed in a
pitched fight by an exhibition of personal pluck and calmness on
Napoleon's part paralleled only by his similar conduct at Krasnoi in
the previous <span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> year. At the head of less than six thousand men,
he held in check nearly fifty thousand until the rest of his columns
came up, when he fell with the old fire upon a hostile line posted
with the river Kinzig in its rear, and not only disorganized it
utterly, but inflicted on it a loss of ten thousand men, more than
double the number which fell in his own ranks. But in spite of this
brilliant success, the ravages of disease continued, and only seventy
thousand men of the imperial army crossed the Rhine to Mainz. Soon the
houses of that city were packed, and the streets were strewn with
victims of the terrible hunger-typhus. They died by hundreds, and
corpses lay for days unburied; before the plague was stayed thousands
found an inglorious grave.</p>

<p>The battle of Leipsic is one of the most important in general history.
Apparently it was only the offset to Austerlitz, as the Beresina had
been to Friedland. In reality it was far more, because it gave the
hegemony of continental Europe to Prussia. French imperialism in its
death-throes wiped out the score of royal France against the
Hapsburgs; Austria was not yet banished from central Europe to the
lower courses of the Danube, but, what was much the same thing,
Prussia was launched upon her career of military aggrandizement. Three
dynasties seemed in that battle to have celebrated a joint triumph; as
a matter of fact, the free national spirit of Germany, having narrowly
escaped being smothered by Napoleonic imperialism, had chosen a
national dynasty as its refuge. The conflict is well designated by
German historians as "the battle of the nations," but the language has
a different sense from that which is generally attributed to it. The
seeds of Italian unity had been sown, but they were not yet to
germinate. The battle of Leipsic seemed to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> check them, yet it
was the process there begun under which they sprang up and bore fruit.
France was destined to become for a time the sport of an antiquated
dynastic system. The liberties which men of English blood had been
painfully developing for a century she sought to seize in an instant;
she was to see them still elude her grasp for sixty years, until her
democratic life, having assumed consistency, should find expression in
institutions essentially and peculiarly her own. Though the conquering
monarchs believed that revolutionary liberalism had been quenched at
Leipsic, its ultimate triumph was really assured, since it was
consigned to its natural guardianship, that of national commonwealths.
The imperial agglomeration of races and nationalities was altogether
amorphous and had been found impossible; that form of union was not
again attempted after Leipsic, while another&mdash;that, namely, of
constitutional organic nationalities&mdash;was made operative. The
successive stages of advance are marked by 1813, 1848, and 1870.</p>

<p>The Saxon campaigns display the completion of the process in which the
great strategist, stifled by political anxieties, became the creature
of circumstances both as general and statesman. The Russian campaign
was nicely calculated, but its proportions and aim were those of the
Oriental theocrat, not of the prosaic European soldier. With the aid
of the railroad and the electric telegraph, they might possibly have
been wrought into a workable problem, but that does not excuse the
errors of premature and misplaced ambition. The Saxon campaigns,
again, are marked by a boldness of design and a skill in combination
characteristic of the best strategy; but again the proportions are
monstrous, and, what is worse, the execution is intermittent and
feeble. As in Russia, the war organism was insufficient for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> numbers and distances involved, while the subordinates of
every grade, though supple instruments, seemed mercenary,
self-seeking, and destitute of devotion. Bonaparte had ruled men's
hearts by his use of a cause, securing devotion to it and to himself
by rude bonhomie, by success, and by sufficient rewards; Napoleon, on
the other hand, quenched devotion by a lavishness which sated the
greediest, and lost the affections of his associates by the demands of
his gigantic plans.</p>

<p>As the world-conqueror felt the foundations of his greatness
quivering, he became less callous and more human. Early in 1813 he
said: "I have a sympathetic heart, like another, but since earliest
childhood I have accustomed myself to keep that string silent, and now
it is altogether dumb." His judgment of himself was mistaken:
throughout the entire season he was strangely and exceptionally moved
by the horrors of war; his purse was ever open for the suffering; he
released the King of Saxony from his entangling engagements; in spite
of his hard-set expression on the retreat from Leipsic, he forbade his
men to fire the suburbs of the city in order to retard the pursuit of
their foes, and before he left Mainz for St. Cloud he showed the
deepest concern, and put forth the strongest effort, in behalf of the
dying soldiery.</p>

<p>The immediate effects of Leipsic were the full display of that
national spirit which had been refined, if not created, in the fires
of Napoleon's imperious career. An Austrian army under Hiller drove
Eugène over the Adige. The Italians, not unsusceptible to the power in
the air, felt their humiliation, and, turning on their imperial King
in bitter hate, determined, under the influence of feelings most
powerfully expressed by Alfieri, that they would emulate northern
Europe. But though they had for years been subject to the new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> influences, enjoying the equal administration of the Code
Napoléon, and freed from the interference of petty local tyrants, they
were neither united nor enlightened in sufficient degree. After an
outburst of hatred to France, they were crushed by their old despots,
and the land relapsed into the direst confusion. The Confederation of
the Rhine was, however, resolved into its elements: the Mecklenburgs
reasserted their independence; King Jerome fled to France; Würtemberg,
Hesse-Darmstadt, and Baden followed Bavaria's example; Cassel,
Brunswick, Hanover, and Oldenburg were craftily restored to their
former rulers before Stein's bureau could establish an administration.
Holland recalled the Prince of Orange, Spain rose to support
Wellington, and Soult was not merely driven over the Pyrenees&mdash;he was
defeated on French soil, and shut up in Bayonne.</p>

<p>Even the three monarchs, as they sedately moved across Germany with
their exhausted and battered armies, were aware of nationality as a
controlling force in the future. In a direct movement on Paris they
could, as Ney said, "have marked out their days in advance," but they
halted at Frankfort for a parley. There were several reasons why they
should pause. They had seen France rise in her might; they did not
care to assist at the spectacle again. Moreover, the coalition had
accomplished its task and earned its pay; not a Frenchman, except real
or virtual prisoners, was left east of the Rhine. From that point the
interests of the three monarchs were divergent. As Gentz, the Austrian
statesman, said, "The war for the emancipation of states bids fair to
become one for the emancipation of the people." Alexander, Frederick
William, and Francis were each and all anxious for the future of
absolutism, but otherwise there was mutual distrust. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> Austria
was suspicious of Prussia, and desired immediate peace. In the
restoration of Holland under English auspices, Russia saw the
perpetuation of British maritime and commercial supremacy, to the
disadvantage of her Oriental aspirations, and the old Russian party
demanded peace. On the other hand, Alexander wished to avenge
Napoleon's march to Moscow by an advance to Paris; and though
Frederick William distrusted what he called the Czar's Jacobinism, his
own soldiers, thirsting for further revenge, also desired to prosecute
the war; even the most enlightened Prussian statesmen believed that
nothing short of a complete cataclysm in France could shake Napoleon's
hold on that people and destroy his power. Offsetting these
conflicting tendencies against one another, Metternich was able to
secure military inaction for a time, while the coalition formulated a
series of proposals calculated to woo the French people, and thus to
bring Napoleon at once to terms.</p>

<p>Ostensibly the Frankfort proposals, adopted on November ninth, were
only a slight advance on the ultimatum of Prague: Austria was to have
enough Italian territory to secure her preponderance in that
peninsula; France was to keep Savoy, with Nice; the rest of Italy was
to be independent. Holland and Spain liberated, France was to have her
"natural" boundaries, the Alps, the Pyrenees, the ocean, and the
Rhine. Napoleon was to retain a slight preponderance in Germany, and
the hope was held out that in a congress to settle details for a
general pacification, Great Britain, content with the "maritime
rights" which had caused the war, would hand back the captured French
colonies. The various ministers present at Frankfort assented to these
proposals for Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia
respectively; but Alexander and Frederick <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> William were
dissatisfied with them, and when Castlereagh heard them, he was as
furious as his cold blood would permit at the thought of France
retaining control of the Netherlands, Antwerp being the commercial key
to central Europe.</p>

<p>Such a humor in three of the high contracting parties makes it
doubtful whether the Frankfort proposals had any reality, and this
doubt is further increased by the circumstances of the so-called
negotiation. St. Aignan, the French envoy to the Saxon duchies, had in
violation of international law and courtesy been seized at Gotha and
held as a prisoner. He was now set free and instructed to urge upon
Napoleon the necessity of an immediate settlement. To his
brother-in-law, the pacific Caulaincourt, who was soon to displace
Maret as minister of foreign affairs, he was to hand a private and
personal letter from Metternich. In the course of this epistle the
writer expresses his conviction that any effort to conclude a peace
would come to nothing. Not only, therefore, were the pretended
negotiations entirely destitute of form, they were prejudged from the
outset. Still further, the allies refused what Napoleon had granted
after Bautzen, an armistice, and insisted that hostilities were to
proceed during negotiation. All possible doubt as to the sincerity of
the proposals is turned into assurance by Metternich's admission in
his memoirs that they were intended to divorce Napoleon from the
French nation, and in particular to work on the feelings of the army.
He says that neither Alexander nor Frederick William would have
assented to them had they not been convinced that Napoleon would
"never in the world of his own accord" resolve to accept them. Yet the
world has long believed that Napoleon, as he himself expressed it,
lost his crown for Antwerp; that had he believed the honeyed words of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> the Austrian minister, and opened negotiations on an
indefinite basis without delay, he might have kept France with its
revolutionary boundaries intact for himself and his dynasty, and by
the sacrifice of his imperial ambitions have retained for her, if not
preponderance, at least importance in the councils of Europe.</p>

<p>Neither Napoleon nor the French nation was deceived; a peace made
under such circumstances could result only in a dishonorable tutelage
to the allied sovereigns. France abhorred the dynasties and all their
works, believing that dynastic rule could never mean anything except
absolutism and feudalism. The experiment of popular sovereignty
wielded by a democracy had been a failure; but the liberal French,
like men of the same intelligence throughout Europe, did not, for all
that, lose faith in popular sovereignty; they knew there must be some
channel for its exercise. Outside of France, as in it, the most
enlightened opinion of the time regarded Napoleon as the savior of
society. The Queen of Saxony bitterly reproached Metternich for having
deserted Napoleon's "sacred cause." This was because the Emperor of
the French seemed to have used the people's power for the people's
good. His giant arm alone could wield the popular majesty. It is said
that the great mass of the French nation, on hearing of the Frankfort
proposals, groaned and laughed by turns. Being profoundly, devotedly
imperialist and therefore idealistic, they were outraged at the
thought of Hapsburgs, Romanoffs, or Hohenzollerns, the very
incarnations of German feudality, as leaders of the new Europe. It
seemed the irony of fate that civil and political rights on the basis,
not of privilege, but of manhood, the prize for which the world had
been turned upside down, should be intrusted to such keepers. Welded
into a homogeneous nationality themselves, the French could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span>
not understand that the inchoate nationalities in other states had as
yet nothing but dynastic forms of expression, or foresee that during a
century to come the old dynasties would find safety only in adapting
royalty to national needs.</p>

<p>Napoleon seems to have been fully aware of French sentiment. In
addition, he understood that not merely for this sufficient reason
could he never be king of France in name or fact, but also that,
having elsewhere harried and humiliated both peoples and dynasties in
the name of revolutionary ideals, the masses had found him out, and
were as much embittered as their rulers, believing him to be a
charlatan using dazzling principles as a cloak for personal ambition.
In May, 1813, the Emperor Francis, anxious to salve the lacerated
pride of the Hapsburgs, produced a bundle of papers purporting to
prove that the Bonapartes had once been ruling princes at Treviso. "My
nobility," was Napoleon's stinging reply, "dates only from Marengo."
He well knew that when the battle should be fought that would undo
Marengo, his nobility would end. In other words, without solid French
support he was nothing, and that support he was fully aware he could
never have as king of France. If the influence of what France
improperly believed to be solely the French Revolution were to be
confined to her boundaries, revolutionary or otherwise, not only was
Napoleon's prestige destroyed, but along with it would go French
leadership in Europe. An imperial throne there must be, exerting
French influence far abroad. What happened at Paris, therefore, may be
regarded as a counter-feint to Metternich's effort at securing an
advantageous peace from the French nation when it should have
renounced Napoleon. It was merely an attempt to collect the remaining
national strength, not now for aggressive warfare, but for the
expulsion of hated invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> Having received no formulated proposition for acceptance or
rejection, and desiring to force one, the Emperor of the French
virtually disregarded the letter of Metternich's communication, and
sent a carefully considered message to the allies. Making no mention
in this of the terms brought by St. Aignan, he suggested Caulaincourt
as plenipotentiary to an international congress, which should meet
somewhere on the Rhine, say at Mannheim. Further, he declared that his
object had always been the independence of all the nations, "from the
continental as well as from the maritime point of view." This
communication reached Frankfort on November sixteenth, and, whether
wilfully or not, was misinterpreted to mean that the writer would
persist in questioning England's maritime rights. Thereupon Metternich
replied by accepting Mannheim as the place for the proposed
conference, and promised to communicate the language of Napoleon's
letter to his co-allies. How far these co-allies were from a sincere
desire for peace is proven by their next step, taken almost on the
date of Metternich's reply. A proclamation was widely posted in the
cities of France, which stated, in a cant borrowed from Napoleon's own
practice, that the allies desired France "to be great, strong, and
prosperous"; they were making war, it was asserted, not "on France,
but on that preponderance which Napoleon had too long exercised, to
the misfortune of Europe and of France herself, to which they
guaranteed in advance an extent of territory such as she never had
under her kings." Napoleon's riposte was to despatch a swarm of trusty
emissaries throughout France in order to compose all quarrels of the
people with the government, to strengthen popular devotion in every
possible way&mdash;in short, to counteract the possible effects of this
call. The messengers found public opinion thoroughly imperial, but
profoundly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> embittered against Maret as the supposed
instigator of disastrous wars. Maret was transferred to the department
of state, and the pacific Caulaincourt was made minister of foreign
affairs. On December second, at the earliest possible moment, the new
minister addressed a note to Metternich, accepting the terms of the
"general and summary basis." This, said the despatch, would involve
great sacrifices; but Napoleon would feel no regret if only by a
similar abnegation England would provide the means for a general,
honorable peace. Metternich replied that nothing now stood in the way
of convening a congress, and that he would notify England to send a
plenipotentiary. There, however, the matter ended, and Metternich's
record of those Frankfort days scarcely notices the subject, so
interested is he in the squabbles of the sovereigns over the opening
of a new campaign. It was the end of the year when they reached an
agreement.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1813-14</p>

<p>What happened in France between the first days of November, 1813, when
Napoleon reached St. Cloud, and the close of the year, is so
incredible that it scarcely seems to belong in the pages of sober
history. Of five hundred and seventy-five thousand Frenchmen, strictly
excluding Germans and Poles, who had been sent to war during 1812 and
1813, about three hundred thousand were prisoners or shut up in
distant garrisons, and a hundred and seventy-five thousand were dead
or missing; therefore a hundred thousand or thereabouts remained under
arms and ready for active service. By various decrees of the Emperor
and the senate, nine hundred and thirty-six thousand more were called
to arms: a hundred and sixty thousand from the classes between 1804
and 1814, whether they had once served or not; a hundred and sixty
thousand from the class of 1815; a hundred and seventy-six thousand
five <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> hundred were to be enrolled in the regular national
guard, and a hundred and forty thousand in a home guard; finally, in a
comprehensive sweep from all the classes between 1804 and 1814
inclusive, every possible man was to be drawn. This, it was estimated,
would produce three hundred thousand more.</p>

<p>It is easy to exaggerate the significance of these enormous figures,
for to the layman they would seem to mean that every male capable of
bearing arms was to be taken. But this was far from being the case;
contrary to the general impression, the population of France had been
and was steadily increasing. In spite of all the butcheries of foreign
and civil wars, the number of inhabitants was growing at the rate of
half a million yearly, and the country could probably have furnished
three times the number called out. Moreover, less than a third of the
nine hundred and thirty-six thousand were ever organized, and not more
than an eighth of them fought. This disproportion between plan and
fulfilment was due partly to official incapacity or worse, partly to a
popular resistance which was not due to disaffection. It speaks
volumes for the state of the country that even the hated flying
columns, with their thorough procedure, could not find the men,
especially the fathers, husbands, and only sons, who were the solitary
supports of many families. The fields were tilled by the spades of
women and children, for there were neither horses to draw nor men to
hold the plows. Government pawn-shops were gorged, and the government
storehouses were bursting with manufactured wares for which there was
no market; government securities were worth less than half their face,
the currency had disappeared, and usury was rampant. Yet it seems
certain that four fifths of the people associated none of these
miseries with Napoleonic empire. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span> generation which had
grown to maturity under Napoleon saw only one side of his activities:
the majestic public works he had inaugurated, the glories of France
and the splendors of empire during the intervals of peace, the
exhaustion and abasement of her foes in a long series of splendid
campaigns&mdash;all this they associated with the imperial rule, and
desired what they supposed was a simple thing, the Empire and peace.</p>

<p>The other fifth was, however, thoroughly aroused. When the legislature
convened on December nineteenth, and the diplomatic correspondence was
so cleverly arranged and presented as to make the allies appear
implacable, an address to the throne was passed, amid thunderous
applause and by a large majority, which virtually called for a return
to constitutional government as the price of additional war supplies.
In sober moments even the most ardent liberals were ashamed, feeling
that this was not an opportune moment for disorganizing such
administration as there was by calls for the reform of the
constitution. Only one question was imperative, the awful
responsibility they had for the national identity. The general public
was so outraged by the spectacle that the deputies reconsidered their
action, and by a vote of two hundred and fifty-four to two hundred and
twenty-three struck out the obnoxious clause. But this did not appease
Napoleon, who made no attempt to conceal his rage, and prorogued the
chamber in scorn. His support was ample in the almost universal
conviction that at such a moment there was no time for parleying about
abstract questions of political rights; but every cavilling deputy had
some friends at home, and in a crisis where the very existence of
France was jeopardized there were agitations by the reactionary
radicals. The royalists kept silent then, and for months later,
contenting themselves with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> biting innuendos or witty double
meanings; drinking, for instance, to "the Emperor's last victory,"
when the newspapers announced "the last victory of the Emperor."</p>

<p>The first conscription from the classes of 1808-1814 was thoroughly
successful, the second attempt to glean from them was an utter
failure; the effort to forestall the draft of 1815 met with
resistance, and was abandoned. It was impossible to organize the home
guards and reserves, for they rebelled or escaped, and local danger
had to be averted by local volunteers who were designated as
"sedentary" because they could not be ordered away. By the end of
January not more than twenty thousand men had been secured for general
service from all classes other than the first&mdash;at least that was
approximately the number in the various camps of instruction. In order
to arm and equip the recruits, Napoleon had recourse to his private
treasure, drawing fifty-five million francs from the vaults of the
Tuileries for that purpose. The remaining ten were transferred at
intervals to Blois. But all his treasure could not buy what did not
exist. The best military stores were in the heart of Europe; the
French arsenals could afford only antiquated and almost useless
supplies. The recruits were armed, some with shot-guns and knives,
some with old muskets, the use of which they did not know; they were
for the most part without uniforms, and wore bonnets, blouses, and
sabots. There were not half enough horses for the scanty artillery and
cavalry. Worse than all, there was no time for instruction in the
manual and tactics. On one occasion a boy conscript was found standing
inactive under a fierce musketry fire; with artless intrepidity he
remarked that he believed he could aim as well as anybody if he only
knew how to load his gun!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> The disaffected, though few, were powerful and active,
suborning the prefects and civic authorities by every device, issuing
proclamations which promised anything and everything, and procuring
plans of fortified places for the allies. Talleyrand began to utter
oracular innuendos about the vindictiveness of the allies, the
desertion of Murat, the sack of Paris, and various half-truths more
dangerous even than lies. The air was so full of rumors that, although
there was no widespread revolutionary movement, there were now and
then serious panics; the town of Chaumont surrendered to a solitary
Würtemberg horseman. But when the populace of the country at large
began to wonder who the coming Bourbon might be, and what he would
take back from the present possessors of royal and ecclesiastical
estates, they were staggered. People in the cities heard with some
satisfaction the strains of the "Marseillaise," which by order of
imperial agents were once again ground out around the streets by the
hand-organs. Napoleon walked the avenues of Paris without escort, and
was wildly cheered; the Empress and her little son were produced on
public occasions with dramatic success, and popular wit dubbed the boy
conscripts by the name of "Marie Louises." The little men showed a
grim determination and eventually a sublime courage, but they never
could acquire the veteran steadfastness which wins battles. Journals,
theaters, music-halls, and public balls were all managed in the
interest of imperial patriotism; imperial tyranny dealt ruthlessly
with suspicious characters. Yet the imperialists had their doubts, and
many, like Savary, threw an anchor to windward by storing treasure at
distant points, and sending their families to safe retreats. On the
whole, the balance of public opinion at the opening of 1814 was
overwhelmingly imperialist both in the cities and in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span>
country. Men ardently desired peace, but they wanted it with honor and
under the Empire.</p>

<p>That the Empire desired peace seemed to be proved by steps for the
release of its two most important prisoners, the King of Spain and the
Pope. Wellington thought that if the former had been despatched
directly into his kingdom on December eighth, the day on which the
conditions between himself and the Emperor were signed, England would
have found the further conduct of the war impossible. Talleyrand,
already deep in royalist plots, must have been of the same opinion,
for he did not advise haste, but craftily suggested to his prisoner
that the provisional government of Spain might refuse to accept him as
king unless the treaty of release had been previously ratified by the
Cortes. Accordingly it was referred to them, and, since the liberals
desired the assent to their new constitution of a king not under
duress, by their influence it was rejected. It was not until March,
1814, that Ferdinand was unconditionally released, and this delay
proved fatal to Napoleon's interests in Spain. The liberals could no
longer fight for free institutions, because it was then clear that the
dynastic conservatism of Europe was to win a temporary victory. In
about six months King Ferdinand undid the progressive work of six
years, and Spain relapsed into absolutism and ecclesiasticism, with
all their attendant evils. Nevertheless, France interpreted the
conduct of the Emperor as indicating an earnest desire for peace, and
this feeling had been strengthened by the absolutely unconditional
release of the Pope on January twenty-second. This apparently gracious
concession was effective among the masses, who did not know, as the
Emperor did, that the allies were already on French soil.</p>

<p>The very next day Napoleon performed his last official act, which was
one of great courage both physical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> and moral. The national
guard in Paris had been reorganized, but its leaders had never been
thoroughly loyal, many of them being royalists, some radical
republicans, and the disaffection of both classes had been heightened
by recent events. But the officers were nevertheless summoned to the
Tuileries; the risk was doubled by the fact that they came armed.
Drawn up in the vast chamber known as that of the marshals, they stood
expectant; the great doors were thrown open, and there entered the
Emperor, accompanied only by his consort and their child in the arms
of his governess, Mme. de Montesquiou. Napoleon announced simply that
he was about to put himself at the head of his army, hoping, by the
aid of God and the valor of his troops, to drive the enemy beyond the
frontiers. There was silence. Then, taking in one hand that of the
Empress, and leading forward his child by the other, he continued, "I
intrust the Empress and the King of Rome to the courage of the
national guard." Still silence. After a moment, with suppressed
emotion, he concluded, "My wife and my son." No generous-hearted
Frenchman could withstand such an appeal; breaking ranks by a
spontaneous impulse, the listeners started forward in a mass, and
shook the very walls with their cry, "Long live the Emperor!" Many
shed tears, and felt, as they withdrew in respectful silence, a new
sense of devotion welling up in their hearts. On the eve of his
departure, the Emperor received a numerously signed address from the
very men whose loyalty he had hitherto had just reason to suspect.</p>

<p>It was four in the morning of January twenty-fifth when Napoleon left
for Châlons. From that moment he was no longer Emperor. During the
long winter nights just past he had wrought with an intensity and a
feverish activity which he had never surpassed, sparing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span>
neither himself nor others, displaying no consideration for prejudice
or honest opposition, calling on every Frenchman to sacrifice
everything for France, to which, as he vehemently asserted, he himself
was more necessary than she to him. If he had come honestly to believe
what millions of others believed, it was little wonder; he had
thenceforth but one aim&mdash;to prove that he was, as of yore, the first
general of France, the only one able to save the country in an hour
when all her glories were falling in wreck about her. His strategic
plans, immense and intricate as was his task, were complete and
excellent. The first was intended to prevent invasion by way of Liège,
the most direct line and that which Prussia preferred. The second,
which was partly defensive, was the one eventually used against the
clumsy form of advance actually chosen by the invaders. Of the two,
the former was the more brilliant, but the second was almost as
clever. By it the Rhine bank was divided into three parts for purposes
of defense. Macdonald was stationed at Cologne to protect the lower
course; Marmont was to guard the central stretch, and they two divided
between them the remnants of the army which had been swept out of
Germany; Victor was stationed on the upper course to command the
garrisons of the great frontier fortifications and strengthen himself
by the new levies; Bertrand remained as a sort of rear post on the
right bank of the river at Kastel, opposite Mainz. All told, these
generals had at first only fifty thousand men.</p>

<p>The allies no sooner obtained possession of central Europe than they
outdid its recent master in every species of exaction. The countries
which had formed the Confederacy of the Rhine were compelled almost to
double the number of the contingents they had raised for France, and
to organize every fencible man into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> either the first or
second line of reserves, called by the old feudal terms of ban and
arrière-ban. At the same time the allies demanded and obtained new
subsidies both of money and arms from Great Britain. In the three
armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, as they stood on the Rhine,
there were ready by January first about two hundred and eighty-five
thousand men. By the end of February the army-lists of France,
excluding the national guards, displayed a total of six hundred and
fifty thousand men; the coalition, including England, had registered
nearly a million. Deducting forty per cent. as ample to cover all
shortcomings, we may say that France, with three hundred and ninety
thousand in the ranks, men and boys, faced Europe with six hundred
thousand full-grown men. These figures include the French armies of
Catalonia, of the Pyrenees, of Italy, and of the Netherlands, together
with the garrisons in all the strong places then held by France on
both sides of the Rhine; they also include the Russian, Austrian, and
Prussian reserves, with the national armies of Holland, Spain, and
Italy.</p>

<p>Aside from the centrifugal forces inherent in the coalition, there was
one which threatened its disintegration: the erratic character of the
great Gascon who represented Sweden. Bernadotte's first care, after
the battle of Leipsic, was to move north and secure the long-coveted
prize of Norway. Ever mindful of the hint about a French crown, which
Alexander had thrown out as still another bait at Abo, he gave as his
parting admonition the transparent advice that the coming campaign
should be confined to a frontier invasion of France, and at Hamburg he
actually offered Davout, as the price of surrender, a safe return for
himself and his army to their native land! This was too much;
Alexander was furious, and the schemer was peremptorily <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span>
ordered to leave a sufficient investing force before the city and
return with the rest of his army to the lower Rhine. There he was
suffered to remain in idleness, the task assigned to him being that of
watching the Netherlands; two of his best corps were withdrawn from
him and assigned to Blücher.</p>

<p>Nor was Napoleon free from his thorn in the flesh. In a bulletin
published by him after the retreat from Moscow was a passage which
implied some censure of Murat for his lack of stability. This both the
King of Naples and his spouse bitterly resented, the latter roundly
abusing her brother in their correspondence. This was an excellent
pretext for desertion when the general crash appeared imminent, and at
Erfurt the dashing and gallant, but weak and testy, monarch decamped.
Hastening south, he entered at once into alliance with Austria, and
then, putting himself at the head of eighty thousand Neapolitans, set
out for Rome, waging a terrific warfare of proclamations. Eugène,
too,&mdash;and this was an elemental disaster,&mdash;was virtually checkmated by
the defection of his father-in-law, the King of Bavaria, which opened
the Tyrol to the allies. All Italy was consequently lost. Augereau,
whose feeble loyalty to Napoleon was already at the vanishing-point,
had been appointed to take forty thousand conscripts, collect any
straggling soldiers he could find in southeastern France, and keep
open the door out of Italy for some or all of Eugène's veterans, with
whose assistance it was hoped the marshal could form an army for the
defense of the Vosges Mountains. But Eugène, having fought the
indecisive battle of Roverbello, and finding himself in a sorry plight
from both the military and political points of view, could send no
reinforcements until April, when finally he concluded an armistice
releasing his army. Augereau <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> therefore found himself opposite
Bubna at Geneva with an ineffective force, and with very little heart
to wield what he had. This ended Napoleon's grand scheme for uniting
the forces of Italy, Naples, Switzerland, and France.</p>

<p>Prussia was now the ablest as well as the bitterest of Napoleon's
foes, Stein, Blücher, Gneisenau, and their friends aiming at nothing
short of annihilating the Napoleonic power. This was, no doubt, due in
part to a thirst for revenge; but in the main it was due to the
longing for such a leadership in Germany as would spread abroad the
new doctrines of liberal and constitutional monarchy, in order to
restrain Austria's ever-increasing influence. The councils of the
allies presented an amusing spectacle. The Prussians urged an
immediate advance by the best line for invasion, that, namely, from
Liège and Brussels; but the Austrians, except Radetzky, drew back,
fearing Prussia almost equally with France. The Czar held the balance,
but his scales were very sensitive, inclining often toward Prussia,
but settling in the end to a compromise suggested by Schwarzenberg and
Metternich. Having imitated Napoleon in his practice of war
requisitions, the allies now determined to imitate him in contempt for
international law, and to violate Swiss neutrality. The plan which
they adopted was to throw their main army into France by way of Basel,
and thus turn the line of frowning fortresses behind the Rhine, as
well as the Vosges Mountains. Blücher was to cross the middle Rhine,
and Bülow, with thirty thousand men, was to coöperate with the English
troops under Graham in the Netherlands. The whole scheme was
unmilitary, but it exactly suited Metternich, who, having on January
thirteenth first learned of Bernadotte's understanding with the Czar
about the crown of France, was very uneasy. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> Both he and
Schwarzenberg desired to end the war on the frontier, if possible;
Prussia's power and Alexander's ambitions for European preponderance
were far more dangerous to Austria than a Napoleonic empire confined
to France.</p>

<p>Blücher, leaving twenty-eight thousand men before Mainz, crossed the
Saar on January ninth with forty-seven thousand; Schwarzenberg, with
the main army arrayed in four columns, two hundred and nine thousand
strong, crossed the Rhine at or near Basel and moved toward Langres.
The thin, straggling French columns began to retreat concentrically
toward Châlons on the Marne. At the opening of the second stage in the
campaign Blücher had invested the Mosel fortresses, and was advancing,
with less than thirty thousand men, toward Arcis on the Aube;
Schwarzenberg was in and about Langres; and the French were
concentrated on a line from Vitry-le-François to St. Dizier. Napoleon
reached Châlons on the twenty-sixth, having left Joseph to represent
him in Paris. The wily strategist, feeble as was his strength, had
momentarily secured the advantage over his unwieldy foe, having wedged
himself between the invading armies, and being quite strong enough,
with the forty thousand soldiers in his ranks, to cope with Blücher.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1814</p>

<p>The year 1814 is the most astonishing of Napoleon's military life. He
first conceived a plan for combining the resources of Italy,
Switzerland, Naples, and France. This failed by Augereau's sloth and
Murat's ingratitude. Nothing daunted, the fertile brain then outlined
schemes for meeting the quick advance of the allies through the
Netherlands, for defending the Rhine frontier, and for a levy <i>en
masse</i> of the French people to hurl back invasion under the walls of
Paris. After taking the field, the daring of his conceptions, the
rapidity of his movements, the surprises he prepared for his enemy,
the support he wrung from an exhausted land, the devotion he received
from a panting, ill-clothed army at bay&mdash;all are so remarkable that by
contrast the allies appear to be a lumbering, stupid mass. With
another antagonist they would have appeared in a very different light;
Gneisenau's clear head, Blücher's daring, Radetzky's good sense and
courage, together <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> with the valor of the forces at their back,
would have won the goal far more easily with an ordinary, or even an
extraordinary, combatant in Napoleon's plight. The Emperor of the
French had not merely a prestige worth a hundred thousand men, as he
was fond of reckoning: he had an activity of mind and body, a
reservoir of resources, which made his single blade cover the whole
circumference of defense like the whirling spokes of a fiery wheel.</p>

<p>After a skirmish for the possession of St. Dizier, the campaign opened
at Brienne, where Blücher, hurrying to gain touch with the main army
of the allies, was caught on January twenty-ninth. The conflict
probably did not recall to Napoleon his mock conflicts when a
schoolboy near the same spot. The terrific struggle began late in the
afternoon, and lasted in full fury until midnight, when the Prussian
general, narrowly escaping capture, abandoned the town and hurried
toward Trannes. Thoroughly beaten, he needed not touch alone, but
actual union with the Austrians, and this he gained near Bar on the
Aube, whence Schwarzenberg was passing on toward Auxerre. Ignorant of
this success, Napoleon now drew up his line with its center at La
Rothière, hoping in the first place to hold the bridge over the Aube
at Lesmont, and thus secure the moral effect of his victory at
Brienne, and in the second to bring on another engagement with
Blücher, whom he believed to be still isolated. Marmont was at
Montierender, Mortier was summoned from before Troyes. This stand of
Napoleon's was a desperate attempt to overawe the allied sovereigns,
for strategically it was fatal, since in the case of either victory or
defeat the French army was in danger of being outflanked by
Schwarzenberg's advance, and thus cut off from Paris. On February
first, Blücher, reinforced by twelve thousand of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span> Russian
guard, attacked. The battle lasted, with fluctuating success for the
allies, during two days, and at its close Napoleon safely retreated
over the Aube to make another stand at Troyes. The various conflicts
were terrific; in the end Blücher lost six thousand dead and wounded,
the French about four thousand. The odds against the latter were never
less than two to one, sometimes more. Had the allies first thrown
their full strength into the contest, and had they then followed up
their victory by a well-organized pursuit, the campaign would have
ended there. As it was, they paused, permitted a disorganized, feeble
enemy to escape, and gained nothing from the bloody conflict except an
ill-founded self-confidence. Blücher wrote on the evening of the
battle that they would be in Paris within eight days. To General
Reynier, who was to be liberated by an exchange of prisoners, the Czar
said: "We shall be in Paris before you." A council of war was called
which decided for an advance on the French capital in two columns; to
Blücher, as the conqueror of La Rothière, was assigned the shortest
line, that down the Marne.</p>

<p>For several days the allied lines moved onward, slowly, widely
scattered, and carelessly. Napoleon was as calm and undaunted as if he
had been the victor. Retreating on the defensive with careful
deliberation, he strengthened his forces by well-chosen periods of
rest, and by hurrying in reinforcements from the various depots about
and beyond Paris. On the afternoon of February ninth, when leaving
Nogent for Sézanne, he wrote to his brother Joseph, whom he had left
to represent his interests at Paris, that he could now reckon, all
told, on between sixty and seventy thousand men, including engineers
and artillery; that he estimated the Silesian army under Blücher at
forty-five thousand, and the main army under Schwarzenberg at a
hundred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> and fifty thousand, including Bubna and the Cossacks.
"If I gain a victory over the Silesian army, and put it out of account
for some days, I can turn against Schwarzenberg, reckoning on the
reinforcements you will send, with from seventy to eighty thousand
men, and I think he cannot oppose me at once with more than from a
hundred and ten to a hundred and twenty thousand. If I find myself too
weak to attack, I shall be at least strong enough to hold him in check
for a fortnight or three weeks, and this would give me the opportunity
for new combinations." To hold Schwarzenberg temporarily, Oudinot with
twenty-five thousand men was stationed on the line from Provins to
Sens, and Victor with fourteen thousand was sent to Nogent. The
Emperor himself, with the old guard, about eight thousand strong, with
Ney and Marmont each commanding six thousand infantry, and with ten
thousand cavalry under Nansouty and Doumerc, set out from Sézanne to
try his fortunes with Blücher.</p>

<p>This was the last of Napoleon's great strategic schemes which was
destined to be crowned with success. It had but a single drawback.
While Napoleon was still the boldest man in war that ever lived, as at
St. Helena he declared himself to be, his marshals were uneasy and
depressed; Marmont, in this moment of infinite chance, as it seemed to
him, fell into a panic. The marshal's fears were not justified, for
his Emperor's daring was not foolhardy. It was calculated on the
myriad chances of his enemy's opportunity and his enemy's ability, and
in this case it was perfectly calculated. Blücher, in spite of
Gneisenau's continuous warnings, was over-confident. Having dispersed
his detachments more than ever, he had for two days been moving
swiftly in the hope of cutting off Macdonald by a dashing feat of
arms. In his haste he had not taken up two Russian corps which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> had been separated from his main line, but on the contrary he
had left them so far out that they were beyond support. By a blunder
of the Czar's, reinforcements which had been promised were still a
long distance in the rear. Schwarzenberg's movements were marked by an
over-confident deliberation as characteristic of him as overhaste was
of Blücher. Accordingly when on the tenth Marmont advanced from
Sézanne, he found the corps of Olsusieff, about forty-five hundred
strong, virtually isolated at Champaubert. His own numbers were
slightly superior, and with a swift rush he annihilated the unready
Russians. Napoleon was beside himself with joy, and began to talk of
the Vistula once more; but he stopped when he saw how sour the visages
of Marmont and the other marshals grew at the very mention of such an
idea. Nevertheless, if the process begun at Champaubert could be
continued, victory and ultimate recovery of something more than French
empire were assured. He therefore hurried Nansouty and Macdonald on
toward Montmirail for a second stroke of the same kind.</p>

<p>The affair at Montmirail was more of a battle than that at
Champaubert, for Blücher had been able to gather in the divisions of
Sacken, York, Kleist, and Kapzewitch. The battle opened about an hour
before noon on the eleventh by a fierce artillery fire from the
French, behind which Napoleon man&oelig;uvered so as to concentrate his
own force against the Russians, and separate them from York with his
Prussians. At two o'clock Napoleon attacked the Russians, Mortier
engaging the Prussians separately. The plan succeeded, and by
nightfall the enemy was in full retreat for Château-Thierry, where was
the nearest bridge over the Marne. Napoleon had hoped that Macdonald
would arrive from La Ferté-sous-Jouarre in time to seize the bridge,
cut <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span> off the retreat, and make the victory decisive. But in
spite of heroic exertion, that marshal could not or did not move with
sufficient rapidity over the heavy dirt roads. The flying allies
sacked the town with awful cruelty, and destroyed the bridge without
any molestation except from the inhabitants, who wreaked their
vengeance on numerous stragglers. On the thirteenth the French
occupied the place, repaired the bridge, and crossed to the right
bank. Next morning Marmont started in pursuit of Blücher.</p>

<p>Somewhat flushed by such success, Napoleon deliberated whether he
should not now turn and attack Schwarzenberg. The Emperor thought
these victories might give pause to a mediocre Austrian, ever mindful
of the terrific blows his country had received once and again from
France. He was mistaken; Schwarzenberg had moved, though slowly, yet
steadily forward. On the twelfth Victor abandoned the bridge at
Nogent, and Napoleon sent Macdonald with twelve thousand men to join
Victor at Montereau. Early on the fourteenth came news that Blücher
had driven Marmont back to Fromentières. By noon Napoleon had effected
a junction with this marshal near Étoges, making a famous and
successful flank march over a marshy country, a man&oelig;uver which is
justly considered worthy of his great genius. Advancing then to the
neighborhood of Vauchamps, his infantry attacked in front, while the
cavalry, under Grouchy, outflanked the enemy's line and fell on the
rear. Blücher was apparently doomed, for he had only three regiments
of cavalry, and while facing one powerful enemy he would be forced to
break the ranks of another in order to open a line of retreat. He
solved the problem, but at enormous cost. Forming his troops into a
line of solid squares, one stood to support the artillery and receive
the onset in front, while the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> others dashed at Grouchy's
horsemen, each square standing and retreating behind the next
alternately as the bloody retreat went on. At last the butchery
ceased, and Blücher fled to Bergères. The French pursued only as far
as Étoges. Napoleon had hoped to follow all the way to Châlons,
annihilate what was left of Blücher's army, and then to return and
throw himself on Schwarzenberg. He was arrested by the news that the
Seine valley, as far as Montereau, was in the hands of the
Austro-Russians; that Oudinot and Victor had been driven back to
Nangis; in short, that Paris was seriously menaced.</p>

<p>It was long asserted that in the three actions just recorded the
French far outnumbered their opponents, and that Napoleon's
generalship was consequently inferior to his high average. The
sufficient answer to this is in the facts now universally accepted. At
Champaubert there were four thousand eight hundred and fifty French
against four thousand seven hundred Russians; at Montmirail there were
twenty-two thousand seven hundred Russians and Prussians against
twelve thousand eight hundred French; and in the third engagement,
near Étoges, Blücher had twenty-one thousand five hundred to ten
thousand three hundred. It is therefore natural to compare these three
victories with those at Montenotte, Millesimo, and Dego. But they were
far greater. At forty-four Napoleon displayed exactly the same
boldness, steadfastness, and skill which he had displayed in youth;
but in addition he overcame the stolid enmity of winter, of variable
weather, of roads almost impassable, of swampy fields that were almost
impassable by reason of overflowing ditches and half-frozen morasses.
He overcame, too, the resisting power created by his own example; for
here were the choicest soldiers of the Continent, commanded by men
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> inured for eighteen years to the hardships, the shifts, the
rapidity of warfare as he himself had taught the art. Momentarily
Napoleon seems to have wondered whether allied and co-allied Europe
had learned nothing in half a generation, and whether an army twice
and a half larger than his own, under veteran generals, was to
withdraw again behind the Rhine, the Elbe, the Oder, perhaps the
Vistula. It is hard to believe that he dreamed such dreams as we read
the prosaic, scientific, hard common sense of his military
correspondence between January twenty-sixth and February fourteenth.
Yet there is certainly an appearance of self-deception and vacillation
in his political and diplomatic plans, due apparently to the
intoxication of success, as when he spoke of the Vistula to Marmont
after Champaubert.</p>

<p>The innermost thoughts of Metternich, and of the diplomats associated
with him, are very hard to fathom. For two generations the world
believed that after Leipsic, Napoleon, in his sanguine conceit,
rejected offer after offer from the allies, and finally perished
utterly because of a folly which made him believe he could recover his
predominance. There is now every reason to believe the contrary, and
to suppose that Napoleon clearly understood the situation. The war was
one of extermination on the part of the allies; in the interest of
their dynasties they intended not only to destroy Napoleon, but also
thereby to root out the ideas for which he was supposed to stand. By
the light of recent memoirs, especially those of Metternich himself,
we seem forced to the conclusion that in all the offers after Leipsic
there was, if anything, far less of reality and sincerity than in
those between the armistice of Poischwitz and the battle. When
Castlereagh arrived at the allied headquarters early in January, 1814,
he found them established in Basel. Schwarzenberg had found no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> difficulty in crossing Switzerland. Geneva surrendered its
keys without a struggle, and generally the Swiss seemed indifferent to
the violation of their neutrality. As the advance continued, it
appeared that the French were equally apathetic. Bubna was driven from
before Lyons by Augereau, but Dijon surrendered to a squad of
cavalrymen which, at the request of the conscientious mayor, made a
show of force to oblige him. It was not difficult under such
circumstances for the sovereigns and their ministers to convince
themselves that any peace with Napoleon would be nothing but a
"ridiculous armistice," and that the Emperor of the French must, in
any case, be utterly overthrown.</p>

<p>In response to the Frankfort proposals, the pacific Caulaincourt had
promptly arrived to conduct negotiations. The invaders had almost at
once suggested that they must abandon the Frankfort proposals, and
confine France to her royal limits; that is, refuse her Belgium with
the great port of Antwerp. So far they were agreed, but there the
unanimity ceased. The Czar desired first to conquer France, and then
leave her to choose her own government; he intended to take the whole
of Poland, and give Alsace to Francis in return for Galicia, thus
checking Austria by both Prussia and France, so that he could work his
will in the Orient. Metternich wished the old balance of power, and
had determined on the restoration of the Bourbons. Francis was writing
to his daughter that he would never separate her cause and that of her
son from France. The Prussian king and ministers desired only such an
arrangement as would secure to their country what she had regained.
Stein and his associates wished the utter humiliation of their foe.
Castlereagh spoke with the authority of a paymaster; he was determined
to keep the Netherlands from falling under French influence, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span> restore the Bourbons, and to establish so nice an equilibrium
in Europe that Great Britain would be unhampered elsewhere in the
world. There was to be no mention of colonial restitution or neutral
rights. Being a second-rate statesman, he was much influenced by
Metternich, and the two sought to form an impossible alliance between
constitutional liberty and feudal absolutism.</p>

<p>A so-called congress was opened at Châtillon on February fifth.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="smaller">[7]</span></a> It
must be remembered that the treaty of Reichenbach was still a secret.
That agreement was the reality behind the congress of Prague, the
Frankfort proposals, and the meeting at Mannheim. None of those
gatherings consequently was serious; that at Châtillon was even less
so. The memoirs of Metternich explain all the facts: Swiss neutrality
was violated by Austrian influence in order to restore the
aristocratic constitution of Bern and the ascendancy of that canton;
Alexander, posing still as a liberal, was angry at this violation of
international law, and forbade the restoration of Vaud to its old
master. Schwarzenberg's deliberate movements were due primarily to
timidity, but they stood in good stead Metternich's desire to restore
the Bourbons. It has been asserted, and there is much probability in
the conjecture, that not only the plan adopted for invading France,
but the slowness of the Austrians in advancing toward Langres, toward
Troyes, across into the Seine valley, together with the spurious
activity they displayed before Montereau, Sens, and Fontainebleau, was
part of a scheme to wear out but not to exhaust France, and then
compel her to take back her dynastic rulers. Blücher, who wanted glory
and revenge, and the Prussian liberals, who desired so to crush France
that Prussia might be free to slough off her militarism and build up
a constitutional government, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> were alike furious at being
chained to the frontier. All these cross-purposes and bitterness were
mirrored in the ostentatious proceedings of the congress of Châtillon.
Napoleon, either divining the facts, or, more probably, informed by
spies, seemed indifferent, and refused at first to give full powers to
Caulaincourt; finally the marshals, terrified at the prospect of
indefinite war opened by the unlucky mention of the Vistula, made
their influence so felt that the Emperor yielded.</p>

<p>Maret's name was long held up to detestation as the instigator of
Napoleon's procrastinating policy at Dresden, the line of conduct
which seemed to have made it possible for Austria to join the
coalition. Among the papers of that minister is an account of his
relations with Napoleon during the congress at Châtillon, which
displays the evident motive of an attempt to prove how pacific his
nature really was. He declares that after the defeat at La Rothière,
Caulaincourt wrote a panic-stricken letter demanding full authority to
treat. Maret handed it to the Emperor, beseeching him to yield.
Napoleon seemed scarcely to heed, but indicated a passage in
Montesquieu's "Grandeur and Fall of the Romans," which he happened to
be reading: "I know nothing more magnanimous than the resolution taken
by a monarch who ruled in our time, to bury himself under the ruins of
the throne rather than to accept proposals which a king may not
entertain. He had a soul too lofty to descend lower than his
misfortunes had hurled him." "But I, sire," rejoined the secretary&mdash;"I
know something more magnanimous&mdash;to cast aside your glory in order to
close the abyss into which France would fall along with you." "Well,
then, gentlemen, make your peace," came the reply. "Let Caulaincourt
make it; let him sign everything necessary to obtain it. I can
support the disgrace, but do not expect me to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> dictate my own
humiliation." Maret informed Caulaincourt, but the latter recoiled
before the responsibility, and asked for particular instructions. The
Emperor persistently refused, but wrote giving the minister "carte
blanche" to take any measure which would save the capital. Again
Caulaincourt begged for details, and again Napoleon refused,
persisting until Bertrand joined his supplications to those of Maret,
whereupon he consented to abandon Belgium, and even the left bank of
the Rhine.</p>

<p>The formal despatch containing these concessions was to be signed next
morning, on February eighth, but in the interval came news of
Blücher's movements. Maret found the Emperor buried in the study of
his map. "I have an entirely different matter in hand," was the
greeting; "I am at present occupied in dealing Blücher a blow in the
eye." The signature was indefinitely postponed. On the tenth Alexander
suspended the congress on the plea of Caulaincourt's refusal to state
his own or accept the offered terms. Then followed the three
victories, and Napoleon, on the night of the twelfth, wrote to
Châtillon demanding the Frankfort proposals. Caulaincourt urgently
besought the allies for an armistice, and begged Napoleon to be less
exacting. Prussia and Austria were eager for the armistice, but
Alexander obstinately refused to reopen the congress until the
eighteenth, when everything seemed changed, and all the allies really
desired peace. Caulaincourt, warned by Napoleon's letter of the
twelfth, refused to treat without full instructions, and as he had
none he began to procrastinate. In the end he bore the blame for not
having used the carte blanche when he had it in order to save his
country, for subsequently he had no opportunity.</p>

<p class="summary">Victor's Failure at Montereau &mdash; Schwarzenberg's Ruse &mdash; The
     French Advance and the Austrian Retreat &mdash; Napoleon's Effort to

     Eclipse.</p>

<p>The eagerness of the Prussians and the Austrians to grant an armistice
was at first due to the belief that Caulaincourt's request was a
confession of exhaustion; the Czar's assent to reopening the congress
on the eighteenth was wrung from him by the military operations
between the fourteenth and that date. Convinced that Paris was
menaced, Napoleon left Marmont to hold Blücher, and starting for La
Ferté-sous-Jouarre on the fifteenth, covered fifty miles with his army
in a marvelous march of thirty-six hours, arriving on the evening of
the sixteenth with his men comparatively fresh. Next morning the
French began to advance, and the Austrians to withdraw toward the
Seine. Victor was to seize Montereau that same day and hold the
bridge. Compelled to drive an Austrian corps out of Valjouan, the
marshal did not reach his goal until six or seven in the evening, and
finding it beset by the Crown <span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span> Prince of Würtemberg with
fourteen thousand Germans, he merely drove in the outposts and then
halted for the night. His ardor was far from intense, and though, like
Macdonald at Château-Thierry, he might feel that he had done all that
could be demanded, yet he lost the opportunity of annihilating a
considerable portion of the enemy's force. Simultaneously Macdonald
had now advanced until he stood before Bray, while Oudinot on the left
was before Provins. Thus far Napoleon's advance had been a front
movement to cover Paris, but that same day, the seventeenth, he drove
Wittgenstein from Nangis, and then expected by a rush over the bridge
at Montereau to prevent Schwarzenberg from extending his flank to
Fontainebleau, a move which would surround the French right. As a
matter of fact, strange riders speaking curious outlandish tongues,
Cossack scouts in other words, had appeared for the first time that
very day in Nemours and Fontainebleau, terrifying the inhabitants. It
seems highly probable that if Napoleon's force could have made a quick
push from Montereau early on the eighteenth, it would have cut off a
considerable portion of Schwarzenberg's left. In any case the Emperor
was deeply incensed by what he considered Victor's slackness, and
degraded him. The humbled marshal confessed his fault, displaying
profound contrition, and was speedily restored to partial favor, being
intrusted with the command, under Ney, of a portion of the young
guard.</p>

<p>This was the third of the marshals&mdash;Augereau, Macdonald, Victor, each
in turn&mdash;who since the opening of the campaign had shown a physical
and moral exhaustion disabling them from rising to the heights of
Napoleon's expectation. "We must pull on the boots and the resolution
of '93," wrote the Emperor to Augereau; he was quite right: nothing
short of the unsapped revolutionary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> vigor of France could
have saved his cause. On the eighteenth, after a six hours' struggle,
the French under Gérard and Pajol seized Montereau. Napoleon had
halted at Nangis, and there Berthier received by a flag of truce a
letter from Schwarzenberg, declaring that he had ceased his offensive
march in consequence of news that preliminaries of peace had been
signed the day previous at Châtillon. This was probably as base a ruse
as any ever practised by Napoleon's generals. It is likely that all
the Austrian marches and countermarches for ten days past had been but
a bustling semblance calculated for diplomatic effect. Be that as it
may, before Napoleon's advance the Austrian commander had quailed,
and, with the French at Montereau, his columns were already moving
back to Troyes, where they were drawn up in battle array. Napoleon
wrote indignantly to Joseph that the ruse was probably preliminary to
a request for an armistice, and that he would now accept nothing short
of the Frankfort proposals. "At the first check the wretched creatures
fall on their knees." Meanwhile he led his army over the river to
Nogent, and prepared to attack Schwarzenberg.</p>

<p>But Blücher had not been idle; by superhuman exertions he had
collected and strengthened his army at Châlons, and on the
twenty-first he appeared at Méry on the Seine, threatening Napoleon's
left flank in case of an advance toward Troyes. By this time the
flames of French patriotism were rekindled in town and country, and,
the soldiers being flushed with victory, it was clearly the hour to
strike at any hazard. Oudinot was despatched with ten thousand men to
hold Blücher, and this task he actually accomplished, capturing that
portion of Méry which lay on the left bank of the river, and
fortifying the bridge-head against all comers. Marmont being at
Sézanne with eight thousand men to cover <span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> Paris, and Mortier
at Soissons with ten thousand to prevent the advance of York and
Sacken, Napoleon marched on Troyes. It was late in the evening when
his main army was drawn up, and in order to leave time for his rear to
come in, he postponed operations until the morning. Schwarzenberg had
seventy thousand in line, but at four in the early dawn of the
twenty-second, leaving in place a front formation sufficient to mask
his movements, he decamped with his main force and withdrew behind the
Aube.</p>

<p>Arrived at Bar, the Austrian commander wrote on the twenty-sixth an
admirable letter of justification for the course he had taken. Defeat
would have meant a retreat, not behind the Aube, but the Rhine. "To
offer a decisive battle to an army fighting with all the confidence
gained in small affairs, man&oelig;uvering on its own territory, with
provisions and munitions within reach, and with the aid of a peasantry
in arms, would be an undertaking to which nothing but extreme
necessity could drive me." This retreat put a new aspect on the
diplomacy of Châtillon. On the nineteenth Caulaincourt received a
despatch from Napoleon revoking the carte blanche entirely; the same
day Napoleon received an ultimatum from the congress, written several
days before, to the effect that he was to renounce all the
acquisitions of France since 1792, and take no share in the
arrangements subsequent to the peace. This last clause being a covert
suggestion of abdication, the recipient flew into a passion; when
finally he was soothed by the pleadings of Berthier and Maret, he gave
such a meaningless reply as would enable negotiations to proceed, but
his counter-project he addressed directly to the Emperor Francis. It
was a refusal to give up Antwerp and Belgium, and an emphatic
recurrence to the Frankfort proposals. "If we are not to lay down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span> our arms except on the offensive conditions proposed at the
congress, the genius of France and Providence will be on our side."</p>

<p>Napoleon's missive suggested to his father-in-law, as was its
intention, that a continental peace on the Frankfort basis would leave
France free to recuperate her sea power and continue the war with
England alone. This was the wedge which for some time past the writer
had been proposing to drive into the coalition so as to separate
Austria from Russia. Castlereagh was very uneasy as to the possible
effect of the message, and there was much anxiety among all the
diplomats. Their first step was to send a pacific reply and renew
their request for an armistice. Napoleon consented, but stipulated
that hostilities should proceed during the preliminary pourparlers,
and that in the protocol a clause should be inserted declaring that
the plenipotentiaries were reassembled at Châtillon to discuss a peace
on the basis proposed at Frankfort. A commission to arrange the terms
of the armistice met on the twenty-fourth. That they were not in
earnest is shown by Frederick William's despatch of the twenty-sixth
to Blücher, saying, "The suspension of arms will not take place." That
very day, also, in a council of war held by the allied generals, it
was determined to form an invading army of the south. Blücher was
authorized to make a diversion in favor of the main army&mdash;a move which
he had really begun the day before by a march to the right. Napoleon,
leaving Macdonald and Oudinot, with forty thousand men, to follow
Schwarzenberg, hurried after Blücher with his remaining force. On the
twenty-eighth the commission adjourned its sessions with a formal
reiteration of the ultimatum already made by the allied powers.</p>

<p>The reason was that by that time its members believed Napoleon to be
elsewhere engaged. Schwarzenberg's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> army had checked Oudinot,
and as his troops recuperated their strength the leader recovered
partial confidence. Blücher being off for Paris, with Napoleon on his
heels, the main army of the allies had then turned on the forces of
Macdonald and Oudinot, and had driven them westward until in the
pursuit it reached Troyes, where it halted, ready, in case of
Blücher's defeat, to recross the Rhine. The congress of Châtillon was
formally reopened on March first, and continued its useless sessions
until the nineteenth, when it closed. During this second period none
of the important dignitaries, except Schwarzenberg and the King of
Prussia, attended; the rest withdrew to Chaumont, where, on March
ninth, the three powers signed a treaty with England, dated back to
March first, binding themselves, in return for an annual subsidy of
five million pounds sterling equally divided, that each would keep a
hundred and fifty thousand men in the field, for twenty years if
necessary, provided Napoleon would not accept the boundaries of royal
France&mdash;a futile stipulation. This treaty was the precursor of that
iniquitous triple alliance between Russia, Austria, and Prussia which
was destined not merely to hamper England herself so seriously in the
subsequent period of history, but to stop for some time the progress
of liberal ideas throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Blücher crossed the Marne on February twenty-seventh with half his
force, and then attempted to cross the Ourcq in order to attack Meaux
from the north. But he was checked by Marmont and Mortier, with the
sixteen thousand men they already had, and then, after six thousand
new recruits came in from Paris, he was forced to retreat. Should
Napoleon arrive in time he would be annihilated. Accordingly he
hastened up the valley of the Ourcq with his entire force. Napoleon
arrived on the Marne too late to attack Blücher's rear, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> and
after some hesitation as to whether he should not return to complete
his work with Schwarzenberg, he finally determined that, inasmuch as
the fortress of Soissons was secure, and Blücher must therefore
retreat to the eastward, he could himself deliver an easy but
staggering blow on the Prussian flank when they should cross the Aisne
at Fismes. Accordingly, on March third the worn-out columns of the
French passed over the Marne. Unfortunately, Soissons had been left by
Marmont in charge of an inexperienced commander, who had surrendered
almost without resistance when, on March second, Bülow and
Wintzengerode, having come in from the Netherlands, suddenly appeared
before the place. This stroke of good fortune enabled Blücher not
merely to find a city of refuge for his exhausted and disorganized
force, but to recruit it by the two victorious and elated corps which
thenceforth served him as an invaluable rear-guard. Napoleon, thwarted
again, gave no outward sign of the despair he must have felt, but
crossed the Aisne on March fifth, and occupied Rheims, in order at
least to cut Blücher off from any connection with Schwarzenberg. He
then turned to join Marmont and Mortier in order to drive Blücher
still farther north, so that, as he wrote to Joseph, he might gain
time sufficient to return by Châlons and attack Schwarzenberg.</p>

<p>In spite of all his discouragements, Blücher had no intention of
retreating without a blow. There was constant friction between the
Prussian commander and his subordinates, so that dissension prevented
prompt action. Nevertheless, after much delay the army was got in
motion to resume the offensive, the general plan being to move
eastward instead of withdrawing due north, to cross the plateau of
Craonne, and, descending into the plain north of Berry, to attack the
French in force as they advanced to Laon. Napoleon had expected to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> meet his foe under the walls of that city; his quick advance
was as much of a surprise to Blücher as Blücher's was to him. The
first shock of battle, therefore, occurred at Craonne on the sixth,
when neither army was in readiness. But Blücher secured the advantage
of position. Though he had only a portion of his force, the troops he
did have were on a commanding plateau above the enemy when the action
began. The skirmishes of the first day, however, were indecisive.
Napoleon's knowledge of the district being defective, he sought to
secure the best possible information from the inhabitants. Some one
mentioning incidentally that the mayor of a neighboring town was named
de Bussy, Napoleon recalled, with his astounding memory, that in the
regiment of La Fère he had had a comrade so named. The mayor turned
out to be the sometime lieutenant, and, with superserviceable zeal,
the former friend poured out worthless information which led the
Emperor to believe that on the morrow there would be only Blücher's
rear-guard to disperse. But it was not so. Blücher struggled with his
utmost might to gather in his cavalry and artillery, while Sacken,
with the Russians, stood like a wall, repelling the successive surges
of Ney and Victor the whole day through. At nightfall the Prussian
commander, finding it impossible to assemble guns or horsemen over the
icy fields, gave orders for retreat, and his army passed on to Laon.</p>

<p>Though Craonne was a victory, the losses of the French were
proportionately greater than those of the enemy, and the pursuit,
though spirited, gained no advantage. "The young guard melts like
snow; the old guard stands; my mounted guards likewise are much
reduced," were the words of Napoleon's private letter. Yet he pressed
on. The night of the seventh he spent in a roadside inn under the sign
of "The Guardian Angel." There Caulaincourt's last messenger from
Châtillon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> found him. The congress was still sitting, but the
warrior knew the fact meant and could mean nothing to him; though the
allies had increased their demands in proportion to their victories,
they had not lessened them in proportion to their defeats. Whatever
terms he might accept, and whatever Metternich might say, this war he
felt sure was one for his extermination. As he said then and there, it
was a bottomless chasm, and he added, "I am determined to be the last
it shall swallow up." So he made no answer, and spent the night
completing his plans for battle at Laon.</p>

<p>That place stands on a terraced hill rising somewhat abruptly from the
plain, and throughout the eighth Blücher arrayed his army in and on
both sides of the city, which itself was of course the key. Napoleon,
being a firm believer in such movements when on friendly soil, made a
long night march. He reached the enemy's fore-posts early on the
ninth, and drove them in. At seven Ney and Mortier began the battle
under cover of a mist, and captured two hamlets at the foot of the
hill. Marmont was on the right, and had already been cut off from the
center by a body of Cossacks; but he attacked the village of Athies.
After a long day's hard fighting, he succeeded in capturing a portion
of it. Further exertion being impossible, his men bivouacked, while he
himself withdrew to the comforts of Eppes, a château three miles
distant. It was noon when Napoleon learned that Marmont had been
severed from the line; at once he renewed his attack on Laon, but
though he gained Clacy on his left, he lost Ardon, and was thus more
completely cut off from Marmont. That night York fell upon Marmont's
men unawares, and routed them utterly.</p>

<p>Napoleon heard of this disaster shortly after midnight. He was, of
course, deeply agitated&mdash;did he dare risk <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> being infolded on
both sides, or should he brave his fate in order to mislead the enemy?
He chose the desperate course, and when day broke stood apparently
undismayed. Even when two fugitive dragoons arrived and confirmed in
all its details the terrible news from Athies, he issued orders as
bold as if his army were still entire. This was a desperate ruse, but
it succeeded, for the pursuit of Marmont's men was stayed. At four the
main French army began its retreat, and the next morning saw it at
Soissons; six thousand had been killed and wounded. Again Napoleon's
name had stiffened the allies into inactive horror, for they did not
pursue. York was so disgusted with the dissensions at Blücher's
headquarters that he threw up his command and left for Brussels.
Blücher was literally at the end of his powers. "For heaven's sake,"
said Langeron, a French refugee in the Russian service, on whom the
command would have devolved, "whatever happens, let us take the corpse
along." "The corpse," with dimmed eyes and trembling hands, traced in
great rude letters an epistle beseeching York to return, and this,
indorsed by another from the Prince Royal of Prussia, brought back the
able but testy refugee.</p>

<p>Meantime Rheims, intrusted to a feeble garrison, had been taken by
Langeron's rear-guard under St. Priest, another French emigrant in the
service of the allies. By this disaster communication between
Schwarzenberg and Blücher had been reëstablished. In the short day
Napoleon could spend at Soissons, he took up twenty-five hundred new
cavalrymen, a new line regiment of infantry, a veteran regiment of the
same, and some artillery detachments. It is not easy to conceive of
recuperative power more remarkable than that which was thus exhibited
both by France and her Emperor. These men had been sent forward from
Paris in spite <span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span> of the profound gloom now prevalent there. The
truth was at last known in the capital; Joseph was hopeless; the
Empress and her court were preparing for extremities. News had come
that in the south Soult had been thrown back on Toulouse; that in the
southwest royalist plots were thickening; that in the southeast
Augereau had been forced back to Lyons; Macdonald was ready to abandon
Provins at the first sign of advance by Schwarzenberg; and the sorry
tale of Laon was early unfolded. Yet the administrative machinery was
still running, and soldiers were being manufactured from the available
materials. Those who had been sent to Soissons had been hastily
gathered, equipped, and drilled almost without hope, but they were
precious since they enabled Napoleon to refit his shattered
battalions.</p>

<p>Marmont had unwisely abandoned Berry-au-Bac, and that in disregard of
orders. But otherwise he had done his best to make good a temporary
lapse, and had got together about eight thousand men at Fismes. His
narratives give a graphic picture of the situation&mdash;of disorder,
confusion, chaos among his troops, of artillery served by
inexperienced sailors, of undrilled companies whose members had
neither hats, clothes, nor shoes. There were plenty of captured
uniforms and head-coverings, but they were so infested with vermin
that the French, sorry as was their plight, refused to wear them, and
clung to their old tatters. Marmont's men were heroes, he himself was
not yet a traitor. Though overborne by a sense of Napoleon's
recklessness, and therefore unfit for the desperate self-sacrifice
which would have made him a fit coadjutor for his chief, he was
prepared to atone for his disgrace at Athies. Early in the morning of
the thirteenth the main French army moved from Soissons; at four in
the afternoon Marmont opened the attack on Rheims. Napoleon himself
had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> arrived, but his troops were slow in coming up, and there
was no heavy artillery wherewith to batter in the gates. The struggle
went on with desperate courage and gallantry on both sides. St. Priest
was killed by the same gunner whose aim had been fatal to Moreau. "We
may well say, O Providence! O Providence!" wrote Napoleon to his
brother. At ten the beleaguered garrison began to sally and flee.
Napoleon rose from the bearskin on which he had been resting before a
bivouac fire, and storming with rage lest his prey should escape,
hurried in the guns, which were finally within reach. Amid awful
tumult and carnage the place fell; three thousand of the enemy were
slain, and about the same number were captured. The burghers were
frenzied with delight as the Emperor marched in, and the whole city
burst into an illumination.</p>

<p>Next morning Napoleon and Marmont met. The culprit was loaded with
reproaches for the affair at Athies, and treated as a stern father
might treat a careless child. No better evidence of the Emperor's low
state is needed. Marmont was now the hero of the hour; his peccadillos
might well have been forgotten for the sake of securing his continued
faithfulness. With Napoleon at his best, this would surely have been
the case; but aware that at most the war could be a matter of only a
few weeks, the desperate man overdid his rôle of self-confidence,
being too rash, too severe, too haughty. Not that he was without some
hope. Although for two years the shadow had been declining on the dial
of Napoleon's fortunes, and although under adverse conditions one
brilliant combination after another had crumbled, yet his ideas were
as great as ever, the adjustment of plans to changing conditions was
never more admirable. The trouble was that effort and result did not
correspond, and this being so, what would have been trifling
misdemeanors <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> in prosperity seemed to him in adversity to be
dangerous faults. The great officers of state and army, imitating
their master's ambitions, had acquired his weaknesses, but had failed
in securing either his strength or his adroitness. With him they had
lost that fire of youth which had carried them and him always just
over the line of human expectation, and so his nice adjustments failed
in exasperating ways at the very turn of necessity. Hard words and
stinging reproofs are soon forgotten in generous youth; they rankle in
middle life; and even the invigorating address or inspiring word, when
heard too often for twenty years, fails of effect. The beginning of
the end was the loss of Soissons at the critical instant. Napoleon was
uncertain and touchy; his marshals were honeycombed with disaffection;
the populations, though flashing like powder at his touch, had nowhere
risen <i>en masse</i>. Thereafter the great captain was no longer waging a
well-ordered warfare. Like an exhausted swordsman, he lunged here and
there in the grand style; but his brain was troubled, his blade
broken. Some untapped reservoirs of strength were yet to be opened,
some untried expedients were to be essayed, but the end was
inevitable. The movement on Rheims was the spasmodic stroke of the
dying gladiator.</p>

<p>Though unscientific as a military move and futile as to the ultimate
result of the war, the capture of Rheims was, nevertheless, a telling
thrust. On receipt of the news from Laon, Schwarzenberg had
immediately set his army in motion against Macdonald, and Blücher,
after waiting two days to restore order among his worried troops and
insubordinate lieutenants, had advanced and laid siege to Compiègne.
The capture of Rheims checked the movements of both Austrians and
Prussians; dismay prevailed in both camps, and both armies began to
draw back. The French halted at Nangis in their retreat before
Schwarzenberg, and the people of Compiègne were released from the
terrors of a siege. "This terrible Napoleon," wrote Langeron in his
memoirs&mdash;"they thought they saw him everywhere. He had beaten us all,
one after the other; we were always frightened <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> by the daring
of his enterprises, the swiftness of his movements, and his clever
combinations. Scarcely had we formed a plan when it was disconcerted
by him." Besides this, in obedience to Napoleon's call, the peasantry
began an organized guerrilla warfare, avenging the pillage,
incendiarism, and military executions of the allies by a brutal
retaliation in kind which made the marauding invaders quake. Finally
the momentary consternation of the latter verged on panic when the
report reached headquarters that Bernadotte, lying inactive at Liège
with twenty-three thousand Swedes, had permitted a flag of truce from
Joseph to enter his presence. Could it be that the sly schemer, for
the furtherance of his ambition to govern France, was about to turn
traitor and betray the coalition?</p>

<p>But the consternation of the allies was the least important effect of
the capture of Rheims by Napoleon.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10"><span class="smaller">[10]</span></a> It initiated certain ideas and
purposes in his own mind about which there has been endless
discussion. Many see in them the immediate cause of his ruin, a few
consider them the most splendid offspring of his mind. Reinforcements
from Paris, slender as they were, flowed steadily into his camp; and
when he learned that both Schwarzenberg and Blücher had virtually
retreated, he believed himself able to cope once more with the former.
Accordingly he dictated to his secretary an outline of three possible
movements: to Arcis on the Aube, by way of Sézanne to Provins, and to
Meaux for the defense of Paris. The first was the most daring; the
second would cut the enemy off from the right bank of the Seine, but
it had the disadvantage of keeping the troops on miry cross-roads; the
third was the safest. Of course he chose the way of desperation&mdash;all
or nothing. Leaving Marmont with seven thousand men at Berry-au-Bac,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> Mortier with ten thousand at Rheims and Soissons, he
enjoined them both to hold the line toward Paris against Blücher at
all hazards, and himself set out, on March seventeenth, for Arcis on
the Aube. This he did, instead of marching direct to Meaux for the
defense of Paris, because it would, in his own words, "give the enemy
a great shock, and result in unforeseen circumstances."</p>

<p>Schwarzenberg's movements during the next three days awakened in
Napoleon the suspicion, which he was only too glad to accept as a
certainty, that the Austro-Russian army was on the point of retreating
into the Vosges or beyond; and on the twentieth he announced his
decision of marching farther eastward, past Troyes, toward the
frontier forts still in French hands. This idea of a final stand on
the confines of France and Germany haunted him to the end, and was the
"will-o'-the-wisp" which intermittently tempted him to folly. But for
the present its execution was necessarily postponed. That very day
news was received within the lines he had established about Arcis that
the enemy, far from retreating, was advancing. Soon the French cavalry
skirmishers appeared galloping in flight, and were brought to a halt
only when the Emperor, with drawn sword, threw himself across their
path. A short, sharp struggle ensued&mdash;sixteen thousand French with
twenty-four thousand five hundred of their foe. It was irregular and
indecisive, but Napoleon held his own. The neighboring hamlet of Torcy
had also been attacked by the allies, and before their onset the
French had at first yielded. But the defenders were rallied, and at
nightfall the position was recaptured. This sudden exhibition by
Schwarzenberg of what looked like courage puzzled Napoleon; after long
deliberation he concluded that the hostile troops were in all
probability <span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> only a rear-guard covering the enemy's retreat.
He was not very far wrong, but far enough to make all the difference
to him. The circumstances require a full explanation.</p>

<p>Thanks to Caulaincourt's sturdy persistence, the congress at Châtillon
was still sitting, and on the thirteenth the French delegate wrote a
last despairing appeal to the Emperor. His messenger was delayed three
days by the military operations; but when he arrived, on the
sixteenth, Maret wrung from Napoleon concessions which included
Antwerp, Mainz, and even Alessandria. In the despatch announcing this,
and written on the seventeenth to Caulaincourt, Maret made no
reservation except one: that Napoleon intended, after signing the
treaty, to secure for himself whatever the military situation at the
close of the war might entitle him to retain. The return of the
messenger was likewise delayed for three days, and it was the
twenty-first before he reached the outskirts of Châtillon. He arrived
to find Caulaincourt departing; the second "carte blanche" had arrived
too late. With all his skill, the persistent and adroit minister had
been unable to protract negotiations longer than the eighteenth. His
appeal having brought no immediate response, he had, several days
earlier, despatched a faithful warning, and this reached Napoleon at
Fère-Champenoise simultaneously with the departure of the messenger
for Châtillon. The day previous the Emperor had received bad news from
southern France: that Bordeaux had opened its gates to a small
detachment of English under Hill, and that the Duke of Angoulême had
been cheered by the people as he publicly proclaimed Louis XVIII King
of France. Apparently neither this information nor Caulaincourt's
warning profoundly impressed Napoleon; he knew his Gascons well, his
"carte blanche" he must have believed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> to be in Châtillon, and
it had been in high spirits that he hastened on to Arcis, determined
to make the most of the time intervening until the close of
negotiations.</p>

<p>When news of Napoleon's advance reached Schwarzenberg's headquarters
in Troyes, there had at first been nothing short of panic; the
commander himself was on a sick-bed, having entirely succumbed to the
hardships of winter warfare. No sooner had he ordered the first
backward step than his army had displayed a feverish anxiety for
farther retreat. As things were going, it appeared as if the different
corps would, for lack of judicious leadership, be permitted to
withdraw still farther in such a way as to separate the various
divisions ever more widely, and expose them successively to
annihilating blows from Napoleon, like those which had overwhelmed the
scattered segments of the Silesian army. The Czar and many others
immediately perceived the danger. With faculties unnerved by fear, the
officers foreboded a repetition with the Bohemian army of Montmirail,
Champaubert, and Vauchamps. Rumors filled the air: the peasantry of
the Vosges were rising, the Swiss were ready to follow their example;
the army must withdraw before it was utterly surrounded and cut off.
There was even a report&mdash;and so firmly was it believed that it long
passed for history&mdash;of Alexander's having expressed a desire to reopen
the congress.</p>

<p>Schwarzenberg's strange hesitancy in the initial stages of the
invasion has been explained. Beyond his natural timidity, it was
almost certainly due to Metternich's politics, which displayed a
desire to ruin Napoleon's imperial power, but to save France either
for the Bourbons or possibly for his Emperor's son-in-law. If the
Austrian minister could accomplish this, he could thereby checkmate
Prussian ambitions for leadership in Germany. But during the
movements of February and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> March the actions of the Austrian
general appear to have been due almost exclusively to cowardice. The
papers of Castlereagh, of Metternich, and of Schwarzenberg himself aim
to give the impression that during all the events which had occurred
since the congress of Prague, everything had been straightforward, and
that Austria had no thought of sparing Napoleon or acting otherwise
than she did in the end. Yet the indications of the time are quite the
other way: the Russians in Schwarzenberg's army were furious, and, as
one of them wrote, suspicious "of what we are doing and what we are
not doing." Alexander, in this crisis, was deeply concerned, not for
peace, but for an orderly, concentrated retreat. With stubborn
fatalism, he never doubted the final outcome; and during his stay in
Châtillon he had spent his leisure hours in excogitating a careful
plan for the grand entry into Paris, whereby the honors were to be his
own.</p>

<p>Consequently, when on the nineteenth he hastened to Schwarzenberg's
bedside, it was with the object of persuading the Austrian commander
to make a stand long enough to secure concentration in retreat. This
idea originated with the Russian general Toll, and the place he
suggested for concentration was the line between Troyes and Pougy. But
the council was terror-stricken, and though willing to heed
Alexander's urgent warning, they at first selected a position farther
in the rear, on the heights of Trannes. With this the Czar was
content, but on second thought such a course appeared to the more
daring among the Austrian staff as if it smacked of pusillanimity.
Schwarzenberg felt the force of this opinion, and by the influence of
some one, probably Radetzky, it was determined, without consulting the
Czar, to concentrate near Arcis on the left bank of the Aube, in
order to assume the offensive at Plancy. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> This independent
resolution of Schwarzenberg's staff explains the presence of allied
troops near Arcis and at Torcy. Alexander was much incensed by the
news of the meeting, and declared that Napoleon's real purpose was to
hold them while cutting off their connections on the extreme right at
Bar and Chaumont. This was in fact a close conjecture. Napoleon,
though surprised into action, was naturally confirmed in his surmise
that the hostile troops were a retreating rear-guard; and in
consequence he had definitely adopted the most desperate scheme of his
life&mdash;the plan of hurrying toward the Vosges, of summoning the
peasantry to rise <i>en masse</i>, and of calling out the garrison troops
from the frontier fortresses to reinforce his army and enable him to
strike the invaders from behind.</p>

<p>By his retreat to Troyes on February twenty-second, Schwarzenberg had
avoided a decisive conflict, saving his own army, and leaving Napoleon
to exhaust himself against the army of Silesia; by his decision of
March nineteenth he had confirmed Napoleon in the conviction that the
allies were overawed, and had thus led his desperate foe into the
greatest blunder conceivable&mdash;this chimerical scheme of concentrating
his slender, scattered force on the confines of France, and leaving
open a way for the great army of invaders to march direct on Paris. Of
such stuff are contemporary reputations sometimes constructed. But
this was not enough: a third time the Austrian general was to stumble
on greatness. Napoleon's movements of concentration had thus far met
with no resistance, in spite of their temerity; and throughout the
nineteenth the enemy's outposts, wherever found, fled incontinently.
It appeared a certainty that the allies were abandoning the line of
the Seine in order to avoid a blow on their flank. That evening
Napoleon began to vacillate, gradually abandoning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> his notion
of an offensive move near Troyes, and deliberating how best to reach
Vitry for a further advance toward his eastern fortresses. To avoid
any appearance of retreat, he rejected the safer route by way of
Fère-Champenoise to Sommesous, and determined to follow the course of
the Aube for a while before turning northward to Sommepuis. He might
run across the enemy's rear-guard, but he counted on their
pusillanimity for the probable retreat of the very last man to Troyes.
When Ney and Sebastiani began on the twentieth to push up the south
bank of the Aube, they expected no opposition. That very morning
Napoleon had announced to his minister of war, "I shall neglect
Troyes, and betake myself in all haste to my fortresses."</p>

<p>So far the Emperor had made no exhibition of the temerity about which
so much was later to be said. But he had deceived himself and had
taken a wild resolution. Moreover, it is amazing that he should have
felt a baseless confidence in Blücher's remaining inert. This
hallucination is, however, clearly expressed in a despatch to Marmont
of the very same date. Yet, nevertheless, the alternative is not left
out of consideration, for he ordered that marshal, in case Blücher
should resume the offensive, to abandon Paris and hasten to Châlons.
This fatal decision was not taken suddenly: the contingency had been
mentioned in a letter of February eighth to Joseph, and again from
Rheims emphatic injunctions to keep the Empress and the King of Rome
from falling into Austrian hands were issued to the same
correspondent. "Do not abandon my son," the Emperor pleaded; "and
remember that I would rather see him in the Seine than in the hands of
the enemies of France. The fate of Astyanax, prisoner to the Greeks,
has always seemed to me the unhappiest in history." The messenger had
been gone but a few hours when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> word was brought that Blücher
had resumed the offensive, and a swift courier was despatched
summoning Marmont to Châlons. In this ultimate decision Napoleon
showed how cosmopolitan he had grown: he had forgotten, if he had ever
understood, the extreme centralization of France; he should have known
that, Paris lost, the head of the country was gone, and that the
dwarfed limbs could develop little or no national vitality.</p>

<p>This bitter lesson he was soon to learn. On the momentous afternoon of
the twentieth, as has been related, about sixteen thousand French
confronted nearly twenty-five thousand of the allies in the sharp but
indecisive skirmishes before Arcis; the loss of the former was
eighteen hundred, that of the allies twenty-seven hundred. In spite of
the dimensions which these conflicts had assumed, Napoleon remained
firm in the belief that he had to do with his retreating enemy's
rear-guard; Schwarzenberg, on the other hand, was convinced that the
French had a strength far beyond the reality. During the night both
armies were strongly reinforced, and in the early morning Napoleon had
twenty-seven thousand five hundred men&mdash;quite enough, he believed, to
demoralize the retreating Austrians. It was ten o'clock when he
ordered the attack, Ney and Sebastiani being directed to the plateau
behind the town. What was their surprise and dismay to find
Schwarzenberg's entire army, which numbered not less than a hundred
thousand, drawn up in battle array on the plain to the eastward, the
infantry in three dense columns, cavalry to right and left, with three
hundred and seventy pieces of artillery on the central front! The
spectacle would have been dazzling to any but a soldier: the bright
array of gay accoutrements, the glittering bayonets, the waving
banners, and the serried ranks. As it was, the audacious French
skirmishers instinctively felt the incapacity of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> a general
who could thus assemble an army as if on purpose to display its
numbers and expose it to destruction. Without a thought they began a
sort of challenging rencounter with horse-artillery and cavalry.</p>

<p>But the Emperor's hopes were dashed when he learned the truth; with
equal numbers he would have been exultant; a battle with odds of four
to one he dared not risk. Sebastiani was kept on the heights to mask
the retreat which was instantly determined upon, and at half-past one
it began. This ruse was so successful, by reason of the alarms and
crossings incident to the withdrawal of the French, that the allies
were again terror-stricken; even the Czar rejected every suggestion of
attack; again force was demoralized by genius. At last, however,
scouts brought word that columns of French soldiers were debouching
beyond the Aube, and the facts were plain. Even then the paralyzed
invaders feared to attack, and it was not until two thirds of
Napoleon's force was behind the stream that, after fierce fighting,
the French rear was driven from the town. Oudinot's corps was the last
to cross the river, and, standing until sappers had destroyed the
bridge, it hurried away to follow the main column toward Vitry. The
divisions of Gérard and Macdonald joined the march, and there were
then forty-five thousand men in line.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was thus neutralizing the efforts of armies and
generals by the renown of his name, two of his marshals were finally
discredited. Enfeebled as Blücher appeared to be, he was no sooner
freed from the awe of Napoleon's proximity than he began to move. On
the eighteenth he passed the Aisne, and Marmont, disobeying the
explicit instructions of Napoleon to keep open a line of retreat
toward Châlons, began to withdraw toward Fismes, where he effected a
junction with Mortier. His intention was to keep Blücher from Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> by false man&oelig;uvers. Rheims and Épernay at once fell into
hostile hands; there was no way left open toward Châlons except the
long detour by Château-Thierry and Étoges; and Blücher, it was found,
was hurrying to effect a connection with Schwarzenberg. This was an
assured checkmate. Meantime Augereau had displayed a similar
incapacity. On the eighth he had begun a number of feeble, futile
movements intended to prevent the allies from forming their Army of
the South. But after a few aimless marches he returned to Lyons, and
stood there in idleness until his opponents had completed their
organization. On the twentieth the place was assaulted. The French
general had twenty-one thousand five hundred men under his immediate
command, six thousand eight hundred Catalonian veterans were on their
way from Perpignan, and at Chambèry were seven thousand more from the
armies of Tuscany and Piedmont. The assailants had thirty-two
thousand, mostly raw troops. With a stout heart in its commander,
Lyons could have been held until the reinforcements arrived, when the
army of the allies would probably have been annihilated. But there was
no stout heart in any of the authorities; not a spade had been used to
throw up fortifications; the siege-guns ready at Avignon had not been
brought up. Augereau, at the very height of the battle, summoned the
civil authorities to a consultation, and the unwarlike burghers
assented without a murmur to his suggestion of evacuation. The great
capital of eastern France was delivered as a prize to those who had
not earned it. Had Suchet been substituted for Augereau some weeks
earlier, the course of history might have been diverted. But although
Napoleon had contemplated such a change, he shrank from disgracing an
old servant, and again, as before Leipsic, displayed a kindly spirit
destructive to his cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> The night after his retreat from Arcis, Napoleon sent out a
reconnaissance to Vitry, and finding it garrisoned by Prussians,
swerved toward St. Dizier, which, after a smart combat, he entered on
the twenty-third. This placed him midway between the lines of his
enemy's communication both from Strasburg and from Basel; which of the
two, he asked himself, would Schwarzenberg return to defend? Thinking
only how best to bait his foe, he set his army in motion northward;
the anxious Austrian would certainly struggle to retain the line in
greatest danger. This illusion continued, French cavalry scoured the
country, some of the Châtillon diplomats were captured, and the
Emperor of Austria had a narrow escape at Bar. It seemed strange that
the country-side as far as Langres was deserted, but the fact was
apparently explained when the news came that the enemy were in force
at Vitry; probably they had abandoned Troyes and had disregarded
Brienne in order to divert him from his purpose.</p>

<p>Alas for the self-deception of a ruined man! The enemy at Vitry were a
body of eight thousand Russian cavalry from the Silesian army, sent,
under Wintzengerode, to dog Napoleon's heels and deceive him, just as
they actually did. Having left Vitry on the twenty-eighth, they were
moving toward St. Dizier when Napoleon, believing that they formed the
head of a powerful hostile column, fell upon them with needless fury,
and all too easily put them to flight; two thousand were captured and
five hundred killed. Thanks to Marmont's disobedience and bad
judgment, Blücher had opened communications with Schwarzenberg, and
both were marching as swiftly as possible direct to Paris. Of this
Napoleon remained ignorant until the twenty-eighth. From his prisoners
the Emperor first gained a hint of the appalling truth. It was
impossible to believe such reports. Orders <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> were issued for an
immediate return to Vitry in order to secure reliable information.
Arrived before the place, Napoleon called a council of war to decide
whether an attempt to storm it should be made. In the moment of
deliberation news began to arrive in abundance: captured despatches
and bulletins of the enemy, confirmed by definite information from the
inhabitants of the surrounding country. There could no longer be any
doubt: the enemy, with an advantage of three days' march, was on his
way to Paris. The futility of his eastward movement appears to have
struck Napoleon like a thunderbolt. Paris abandoned in theory was one
thing; France virtually decapitated by the actual loss of its capital
was quite another. The thought was unendurable. Mounting his horse,
the unhappy man spurred back to St. Dizier, and closeted himself in
silent communing with his maps.</p>

<p>The allies had not at first divined Napoleon's purpose. Indeed, their
movements in passing the Aube and on the day following were little
better than random efforts to fathom it. But on the morning of the
twenty-third two important messengers were captured&mdash;one a courier
from Berthier to Macdonald with despatches stating exactly where
Napoleon was; the other a rider with a short note from Napoleon to his
Empress, containing a statement of its writer's plans. This famous
paper was lost, for Blücher, after having read it, let the rider go.
But the extant German translation is doubtless accurate. It runs: "My
friend, I have been all day in the saddle. On the twentieth I took
Arcis on the Aube. The enemy attacked at eight in the evening. I beat
him, killed four thousand men, and captured four cannon. On the
twenty-first the enemy engaged in order to protect the march of his
columns toward Brienne and Bar on the Aube. I have resolved to betake
myself to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> the Marne in order to draw off the enemy from Paris
and to approach my fortifications. I shall be this evening in St.
Dizier. Adieu, my friend; kiss my boy." Savary declares that there was
a final phrase: "This movement makes or mars me."</p>

<p>The menace to their lines of communication at first produced
consternation in the council of the allies. The first proposition laid
before them was that they should return on parallel lines and recover
their old bases. Had this scheme been adopted, Napoleon's strategy
would have been justified completely instead of partially as it was;
nothing but a miracle could have prevented the evacuation of France by
the invaders. But a second, calmer thought determined the invaders to
abandon both the old lines, and, opening a new one by way of Châlons
into the Netherlands, to make the necessary detour and fall on
Napoleon's rear. Francis, for the sake of keeping close touch with his
own domains, was to join the Army of the South at Lyons. Although
there is no proof to support the conjecture, it seems as if the Czar
and the King of Prussia had suggested this so that both Francis and
Metternich might be removed from the military councils of the allies
in order that the more warlike party might in their absence take
decisive measures. That night a package of letters to Napoleon from
the imperial dignitaries at Paris fell into the hands of the invaders.
The writers, each and all, expressed a profound despondency, Savary in
particular asserting that everything was to be feared should the enemy
approach the capital. Next morning, the twenty-fourth, the junction
between Blücher and Schwarzenberg was completed. Francis and
Metternich being absent, Schwarzenberg, listening to warlike advice,
determined to start immediately in pursuit of Napoleon and seek a
battle. The march was begun, and it seemed as if Napoleon's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span>
wild scheme was to be completely justified. He had certainly displayed
profound insight.</p>

<p>Alexander, however, had been steadily hardening his purpose to
annihilate Napoleon. For a week past Vitrolles, the well-known
royalist agent, had been at his headquarters; the accounts of a steady
growth in royalist strength, the efforts of Napoleon's lifelong foe,
Pozzo di Borgo, and the budget of despondent letters from the Paris
officials, combined to temper the Czar's mystical humor into a
determination of steel. Accordingly, on the same day he summoned his
personal military advisers, Barclay, Wolkonsky, Diebitsch, and Toll;
then, pointing out on a map the various positions of the troops
engaged in the campaign, he asked, significantly and impressively,
whether it were best to pursue Napoleon or march on Paris. Barclay
supported the former alternative; Diebitsch advised dividing the army
and doing both; but Toll, with powerful emphasis, declared himself for
the second course. The Czar listened enthusiastically to what was near
his own heart, and expressed himself strongly as favoring it; the
others yielded with the eagerness of courtiers, and Alexander,
mounting his horse, spurred after Frederick William and Schwarzenberg.
The new plan was unfolded; the Prussian king supported it;
Schwarzenberg hesitated, but yielded. That night orders were issued
for an about-face, a long explanatory despatch was sent to Blücher,
and on the twenty-fifth the combined armies of Bohemia and Silesia
were hurrying with measured tramp toward Paris. For the first time
there was general enthusiasm in their ranks. Blücher, who from his
unremitted ardor had won the name of "Marshal Forward," was
transported with joy.</p>

<p>The two armies marched on parallel lines, and met with no resistance
of any importance, except as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span> various skirmishes enabled
the irregular French soldiers to display a desperate courage, not only
the untried "Marie Louises" coming out from Paris, but various bodies
of the national guard convoying provision-trains. It was the
twenty-fifth before Marmont and Mortier effected their junction, and
then, although about sixteen thousand strong, they were steadily
forced back through Fère-Champenoise and Allemant toward Charenton,
which was under the very walls of Paris. Marmont displayed neither
energy nor common sense on the retreat: his outlying companies were
cut off, and strategic points which might have been held were utterly
neglected. The army with which he reached Paris on the twenty-ninth
should have formed an invaluable nucleus for the formation and
incorporation of the numerous volunteers and irregular companies which
were available; but, like its leader, it was entirely demoralized.
Ledru des Essarts, commander of Meaux, was obliged on the
twenty-seventh to abandon his charge, a military depot full of
ammunition and supplies, which was essential to the safety of Paris.
The garrison consisted of six thousand men, but among them were not
more than eight hundred veterans, hastily collected from Marmont's
stragglers, and the new conscripts were ill-conditioned and badly
commanded. Although the generals drew up their men with a bold front
to defend the passage of the Marne, the undisciplined columns were
overwhelmed with terror at the sight of Blücher's army, and, standing
only long enough to blow up the magazines, fled. They fought
gallantly, however, on their retreat throughout the twenty-eighth, but
to no avail; one position after another was lost, and they too
bivouacked on the evening of the twenty-ninth before the gates of the
capital. It is a weak curiosity, possibly, but we must wonder what
would have occurred had Marmont, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> instead of retreating to
Fismes on the eighteenth, withdrawn to Rheims, where he and Mortier
could at least have checked Blücher's unauthorized advance, and
perhaps have held the army of Silesia for a time, when the moral
effect would probably have been to justify Schwarzenberg and confirm
his project for the pursuit of Napoleon. In that case, moreover, the
precious information of Napoleon's letter to his consort would not
have fallen into his enemies' hands. Would destiny have paused in its
career?</p>

<p class="summary">Napoleon's Problem &mdash; The Military Situation &mdash; A Council of War
     and State &mdash; The Return to Paris &mdash; Prostrating News &mdash; The
     Empress-Regent and her Advisers &mdash; Traitors Within &mdash; Talleyrand
     &mdash; The Defenders of the Capital &mdash; The Flight of the Court &mdash; The
     Allies before the City.</p>

<p>The pallid, silent Emperor at St. Dizier was closeted with
considerations like these. He knew of the defeat which forced Marmont
and Mortier back on Paris; the loss of the capital was imminent;
parties were in a dangerous state; his marshals were growing more and
more slack; he had failed in transferring the seat of war to Lorraine;
the information he had so far received was almost certainly colored by
the medium of scheming followers through which it came. What single
mind could grapple with such affairs? It was not because the thwarted
man had lost his nerve, but because he was calm and clear-minded, that
he felt the need of frank, dispassionate advice on all these matters.
On the other hand, there stood forth in the clearest light a single
fact about which there could be no doubt, and it alone might
counterbalance all the rest: the peoples of northern and eastern
France were at last aroused in behalf of his cause. For years all
Europe had rung with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> outcries against the outrages of
Napoleon's soldiery; the allied armies no sooner became invaders in
their turn than they began to outstrip their foe in every deed of
shame; in particular, the savage bands from Russian Asia indulged
their inhuman passions to the full, while the French peasantry, rigid
with horror, looked on for the moment in paralysis. Now they had begun
to rise in mass, and from the twenty-fifth to the twenty-eighth their
volunteer companies brought in a thousand prisoners. The depots,
trains, and impedimenta of every sort which the allies abandoned on
turning westward fell into the hands of a peasant soldiery, many of
whom were armed with shot-guns. The rising for Napoleon was comparable
only to that which earlier years had seen in the Vendée on behalf of
the Bourbons.</p>

<p>Besides, all the chief cities of the district were now in the hands of
more or less regular troops; Dunette was marching from Metz with four
thousand men; Broussier, from Strasburg with five thousand; Verdun
could furnish two thousand, and several other fortresses a like
number. Souham was at Nogent with his division, Allix at Auxerre with
his; the army at the Emperor's disposal could easily be reckoned at
seventy thousand. Assisted by the partizan bands which now hung in a
passion of hatred on the skirts of the invaders, and by the national
uprising now fairly under way, could not the Emperor-general hope for
another successful stand? He well knew that the fear of what had
happened was the specter of his enemy's council-board; they would, he
reckoned, be rendered over-cautious, and give him at least a fortnight
in which to man&oelig;uver before the fall of Paris could be expected.
Counting the men about Vitry and the garrison reinforcements at only
sixty thousand, the combined armies of Suchet, Soult, and Augereau at
the same number, that of Marmont <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> at fourteen thousand, and
the men in the various depots at sixteen thousand, he would have a
total of a hundred and fifty thousand, from which he could easily
spare fifty thousand to cut off every line of retreat from his foe,
and still have left a hundred thousand wherewith to meet their
concentrated force on a basis of something like equality. From the
purely strategic point of view, the march of the allies to Paris was
sheer madness unless they could count on the exhaustion of the
population right, left, and behind. If the national uprising could be
organized, they would be cut off from all reinforcement and entrapped.
Already their numbers had been reduced to a hundred and ten thousand
men. Napoleon with a hundred thousand, and the nation to support him,
had a fair chance of annihilating them.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, not a mere hallucination which led him to hope that
once again the tangled web of affairs might be severed by a sweep of
the soldier's saber. But of course in the crisis of his great decision
he could not stand alone; he must be sure of his lieutenants.
Accordingly, after a few hours of secret communing, he summoned a
council, and laid before it his considerations substantially as
enumerated. Those present were Berthier, Ney, Lefebvre, Caulaincourt,
and Maret; Oudinot and Macdonald, at Bar on the Ornain and Perthes
respectively, were too distant to arrive in time, but he believed that
he knew their opinion, which was that the war should be continued
either in Lorraine or from a center of operations to be established at
Sens. From this conclusion Macdonald did not once waver; Oudinot had
begun to hedge; their absence, therefore, was unimportant. Berthier
was verging on desperation, and so was Caulaincourt, who, since
leaving Châtillon, had been vainly struggling to reopen negotiations
for peace on any terms; Ney, though physically brave, was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> the stuff from which martyrs are made, and Lefebvre,
naturally weak, was laboring under a momentary attack of senility. The
council was imperative for peace at any price; the Emperor, having
foreseen its temper, had little difficulty in taking the military
steps for carrying out its behests.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of March twenty-eighth the army was set in motion
toward Paris. The line of march was to be through Bar on the Aube,
Troyes, and Fontainebleau, a somewhat circuitous route, chosen
apparently for three reasons: because the region to be traversed would
still afford sustenance to the men, because the Seine would protect
its right flank, and because the dangerous point of Meaux was thus
avoided. Such a conclusion is significant of the clearest judgment and
the nicest calculation. Pages have been written about Napoleon's
hallucinations at the close of his career; neither here nor in any of
the courses he adopted is there aught to sustain the charge. At
breakfast-time a squad of jubilant peasants brought in a prisoner whom
they believed to be no less a person than the Comte d'Artois. In
reality it was Weissenberg, an Austrian ambassador on his way to
London. He was promptly liberated on parole and despatched with
letters to Francis and Metternich. By a curious adventure, Vitrolles
was in the minister's suite disguised as a serving-man, but he was not
detected.</p>

</div>

<p>At Doulevant Napoleon received cipher despatches from La Valette, the
postmaster-general in Paris, a trusted friend. These were the first
communications since the twenty-second; the writer said not a moment
must be wasted, the Emperor must come quickly or all would be lost.
His decision once taken, Napoleon had grown more feverish with every
hour; this message gave wings to his impatience. With some regard
for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> such measures as would preclude his capture by wandering
bands of Cossacks, he began almost to fly. New couriers were met at
Doulaincourt with despatches which contained a full history of the
past few days; in consequence the troops were spurred to fresh
exertions, their marches were doubled, and at nightfall of the
twenty-ninth Troyes was reached. Snatching a few brief hours of sleep,
Napoleon at dawn next morning threw discretion to the winds, and
started with an insufficient escort, determined to reach Villeneuve on
the Vanne before night. The task was performed, but no sooner had he
arrived than at once he flung himself into a post-chaise, and, with
Caulaincourt at his side, sped toward Paris; a second vehicle, with
three adjutants, followed as best it might; and a third, containing
Gourgaud and Lefebvre, brought up the rear. It will be remembered that
Gourgaud was an able artillerist; Lefebvre, it was hoped, could rouse
the suburban populations for the defense of Paris. At Sens Napoleon
heard that the enemy was ready to attack; at Fontainebleau that the
Empress had fled toward the Loire; at Essonnes he was told that the
decisive battle was raging; and about ten miles from the capital, at
the wretched posting-station of La Cour de France, deep in the night,
fell the fatal blow. Paris had surrendered. The terrible certainty was
assured by the bearer of the tidings, Belliard, a cavalry officer
despatched with his troop by Mortier to prepare quarters for his own
and Marmont's men.</p>

<p>Maria Louisa had played her rôle of Empress-regent as well as might be
expected from a woman of twenty-three with slender abilities; only
once in his letters did the Emperor chide her, and that was for a
fault at that time venial in European royalty: receiving a high
official, in this case the arch-chancellor, in her bedchamber. On the
whole, she had been dignified and conciliatory; once <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> she rose
to a considerable height, pronouncing before the senate with great
effect a stirring speech composed by her husband and forwarded from
his headquarters. About her were grouped a motley council: Joseph,
gentle but efficient; Savary, underhanded and unwarlike; Clarke,
working in the war ministry like a machine; Talleyrand, secretly
plotting against Napoleon, whose title of vice-grand elector he wore
with outward suavity; Cambacérès, wise but unready; Montalivet, adroit
but cautious. Yet, while there was no one combining ability,
enthusiasm, and energy, the equipment of troops had gone on with great
regularity, and each day regiments of half-drilled, half-equipped
recruits had departed for the seat of war. The national guards who
garrisoned the city, some twelve thousand in all, had forgotten their
imperialism, having grown very sensitive to the shafts of royalist
wit; yet they held their peace and had performed the round of their
duties. Everything had outwardly been so quiet and regular that
Napoleon actually contemplated a new levy, but the emptiness of the
arsenals compelled him to dismiss the idea. Theoretically a fortified
military depot, Paris was really an antiquated fortress with arsenals
of useless weapons. Spasmodic efforts had been made to throw up
redoubts before the walls, but they had failed from lack of energy in
the military administration.</p>

<p>A close examination of what lay beneath the surface of Parisian
society revealed much that was dangerous. Talleyrand's house was a
nest of intrigue. Imperial prefects like Pasquier and Chabrol were
calm but perfunctory. The Talleyrand circle grew larger and bolder
every day. Moreover, it had influential members&mdash;de Pradt, Louis,
Vitrolles, Royer-Collard, Lambrecht, Grégoire, and Garat, together
with other high functionaries in all departments. Bourrienne
developed great activity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> as an extortioner and briber; the
great royalist irreconcilables, Montmorency, Noailles, Denfort,
Fitz-James, and Montesquiou, were less and less careful to conceal
their activity. Jaucourt, one of Joseph's chamberlains, was a spy
carrying the latest news from headquarters to the plotters. "If the
Emperor were killed," he wrote on March seventeenth, "we should then
have the King of Rome and the regency of his mother.... The Emperor
dead, we could appoint a council which would satisfy all opinions.
Burn this letter." The program is clear when we recall that the little
King of Rome was not three years old. Napoleon was well aware of the
increasing chaos, and smartly reproved Savary from Rheims.</p>

<p>But Talleyrand was undaunted. At first he appears to have desired a
violent death for Napoleon, in the hope of furthering his own schemes
during a long imperial regency. At all events, he ardently opposed the
departure of the Empress and the King of Rome from Paris. Nevertheless
it was he who despatched Vitrolles, the passionate royalist, to
Nesselrode with a letter in invisible ink which, when deciphered,
turned out to be an inscrutable riddle capable of two interpretations.
"The bearer of this deserves all confidence. Hear him and know me. It
is time to be plain. You are walking on crutches; use your legs and
will to do what you can." Lannes had long before stigmatized the
unfrocked bishop as a mess of filth in a silk stocking; Murat said he
could take a kick from behind without showing it in his face; in the
last meeting of the council of state before the renewal of
hostilities, Napoleon fixed his eyes on the sphinx-like cripple and
said: "I know I am leaving in Paris other enemies than those I am
going to fight." His fellow-conspirators were scarcely less bitter in
their dislike than his avowed enemies. "You don't know the monkey,"
said Dalberg <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> to Vitrolles; "he would not risk burning the tip
of his paw even if all the chestnuts were for himself." Yet, master of
intrigue, he pursued the even tenor of his course, scattering
innuendos, distributing showers of anonymous pamphlets, smuggling
English newspapers into the city, in fact working every wire of
conspiracy. Surprised by the minister of police in an equivocal
meeting with de Pradt, he burst out into hollow laughter, his
companion joined in the peal, and even Savary himself found the
merriment infectious.</p>

<p>Toward the close of March the populace displayed a perilous
sensitiveness to all these influences. The London "Times" of March
fifteenth, which was read by many in the capital, asked what pity
Blücher and the Cossacks would show to Paris on the day of their
vengeance, the editor suggesting that possibly as he wrote the famous
town was already in ashes. Such suggestions created something very
like a panic, and a week later the climax was reached. When the
fugitive peasants from the surrounding country began to take refuge in
the capital they found business at a standstill, the shops closed, the
streets deserted, the householders preparing for flight. From the
twenty-third to the twenty-eighth there was no news from Napoleon; the
Empress and council heard only of Marmont's defeat. They felt that a
decision must be taken, and finally on the twenty-eighth the imperial
officials held a council. The facts were plainly stated by Clarke; he
had but forty-three thousand men, all told, wherewith to defend the
capital, and in consequence it was determined to send the Empress and
her son to Rambouillet on the very next day. This fatal decision was
taken partly through fear, but largely in deference to Napoleon's
letter containing the classical allusion to Astyanax. The very men who
took it believed that the Parisian masses would have died <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span>
for the young Napoleon, and deplored the decision they had reached.
"Behold what a fall in history!" said Talleyrand to Savary on parting.
"To attach one's name to a few adventures instead of affixing it to an
age.... But it is not for everybody to be engulfed in the ruins of
this edifice." From that hour the restoration of the Bourbons was a
certainty.</p>

<p>It was a mournful procession of imperial carriages which next morning
filed slowly through the city, attracting slight attention from a few
silent onlookers, and passed on toward Rambouillet. The baby king had
shrieked and clutched at the doors as he was torn away from his
apartments in the Tuileries, and would not be appeased; his mother and
attendants were in consternation at the omen, and all thoughtful
persons who considered the situation were convinced that the
dissolution of the Empire was at hand. A deputation from the national
guard had sought in vain to dissuade the Empress from her course;
their failure and the distant booming of cannon produced widespread
depression throughout the city, which was not removed by a spirited
proclamation from Joseph declaring that his brother was on the heels
of the invaders. All the public functionaries seemed inert, and
everybody knew that, even though the populace should rise, there was
no adequate means of resistance either in men or in arms or in proper
fortifications.</p>

<p>Clarke alone began to display energy; with Joseph's assistance, what
preparations were possible at so late an hour were made: six companies
were formed from the recruits at hand, the national guard was put
under arms, the students of the polytechnic school were called out for
service, communication with Marmont was secured, and by late afternoon
Montmartre, Belleville, and St. Denis were feebly fortified. The
allies had been well <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> aware that what was to be done must be
done before the dreaded Emperor should arrive, and on that same
morning their vanguard had summoned the town; but during the parley
their generals began to feel the need of greater strength, and further
asked an armistice of four hours. This was granted on the usual
condition that within its duration no troops should be moved; but the
implied promise was perfidiously broken, and at nightfall both
Alexander and Frederick William, accompanied by their forces, were in
sight of the far-famed city. Dangers, hardships, bygone insults and
humiliations, all were forgotten in a general tumult of joy, wrote
Danilevsky, a Russian officer. Alexander alone was pensive, well
knowing that, should the city hold out two days, reinforcements from
the west might make its capture impossible until Napoleon should
arrive. Accordingly he took virtual command, and issued stringent
orders preparatory for the assault early next morning.</p>

     Napoleon's New Policy Foreshadowed &mdash; His Troops and Officers &mdash;
     The Treason of Marmont &mdash; The Marshals at Fontainebleau &mdash;
     Napoleon's Despair.</p>

<p>From early dawn until midday on March thirtieth the fighting before
Paris was almost continuous, the assailants displaying an assurance of
victory, the defenders showing the courage of despair. Marmont and
Mortier kept their ranks in order, and the soldiers fought gallantly;
elsewhere the militia and the boys emulated each other and the
regulars in steadfastness. But when, shortly after noon, it became
evident that Paris was doomed to fall before superior force, Joseph,
as deputy emperor, issued to Marmont full powers to treat, and
followed the Empress, whom he overtook at Chartres, far beyond
Rambouillet, where she had expected to halt. She had determined, for
greater safety, to cross the Loire. At four in the afternoon the
Prussians captured Montmartre, and prepared to bombard from that
height; at the same moment the last ranks of the allied armies came
up.</p>

<p>Marmont felt further resistance to be useless; his line <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> of
retreat was endangered, and he had special directions not to expose
the city to a sack. There was still abundant courage in the citizens,
who stood behind the barricades within the gates clamorous for arms
and ammunition. A messenger came galloping in with the news that
Napoleon was but half a day distant. The lookouts now and then espied
some general riding a white horse, and called, "'Tis he!" But for all
the enthusiasm, the expected "he" did not appear. Further carnage
seemed useless, since French honor had been vindicated, and when the
war-worn Marmont withdrew into the town he was received as one who had
done what man could do. Negotiations once fairly begun, the allies
abandoned the hard conditions with which they opened the parley, and
displayed a sense of great relief. Their chief representative, Count
Orloff, behaved with much consideration. Recognizing the force of the
French plea that their army was quite strong enough, if not to defend
the city another twenty-four hours, at least to contest it street by
street until, arrived at last on the left bank of the Seine, they
could regain Fontainebleau in safety, Orloff assented to what were
virtually the stipulations of Marmont and Mortier. The terms adopted
made provision for an armistice, assured kind treatment to the city,
and permitted the withdrawal of the troops.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon and evening Marmont's house was the
rendezvous of the negotiators and of the few political personages left
in the city. There was the freest talk: "Bonaparte" was conquered; the
Bourbons would be restored; what a splendid man was this Marmont! Some
weeks earlier the marshal had been significantly informed by his
brother-in-law Perregaux, a chamberlain of Napoleon's, that in case of
a restoration he and Macdonald would be spared, whatever happened to
the other great imperial leaders. Talleyrand had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> ostensibly
taken flight with his colleagues, but by an interesting coincidence
his coachman had sought the wrong exit from the city, and had been
turned back. That night he appeared in Marmont's presence with direct
overtures from the Bourbons. His interview was short, and he seemed to
have gained nothing; but he had an air of victory as he withdrew. He
saw that Marmont was consumed with vanity, feeling that the destinies
of France, of Napoleon, of all Europe, perhaps, were in his hands
alone. This was much. Passing through the corridors, the sly
diplomatist respectfully greeted Prince Orloff, and begged to lay his
profound respects at the feet of the Czar. "I shall not forget to lay
this blank check before his majesty," was the stinging retort.
Talleyrand smiled almost imperceptibly with his lips, and went his
way. But Alexander said on hearing the facts: "As yet this is but
anecdote; it may become history."</p>

<p>The triumphal entry of the allies into Paris began next morning, March
thirty-first, 1814, at seven o'clock. It was headed by Alexander and
Frederick William, now universally regarded as the Czar's satellite
king. Francis was in Dijon; he was represented by Schwarzenberg. The
three leaders, with their respective staff officers, were solemnly
received by a deputation of the municipal authorities. Their soldiers
were orderly, and there was no pillage or license. Crowds of royalists
thronged the streets acclaiming the conquerors and shouting for Louis
XVIII. Throughout the afternoon Talleyrand and Nesselrode were
closeted in the former's palace; and when, toward evening, they were
joined by the Czar and the King, both of whom had devoted the day to
ceremony, the diplomats had already agreed that France must have the
Bourbons. The sovereigns had actually been deceived by the noisy
royalist manifestations <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> into believing that France welcomed
her invaders, and they assented to the conclusion of the ministers. A
formal meeting was instantly arranged; there were present, besides the
monarchs and their ministers, Schwarzenberg, Lichtenstein, Dalberg,
and Pozzo di Borgo. Alexander assumed the presidency, but Talleyrand,
with consummate skill, monopolized the deliberations. The Czar
suggested, as various bases for peace, Napoleon under all guaranties,
Maria Louisa as regent for the King of Rome, the Bourbons, and, it is
believed, hinted at Bernadotte or the republic as possibilities. Of
all these courses there was but one which represented the notion of
legitimacy with which Alexander had in the coalition identified
himself, and by which alone he, with his shady title, could hope to
assert authority in western Europe. This was expounded and emphasized
by the wily Talleyrand with tremendous effect. The idea of the
republic was of course relegated to oblivion; of Bernadotte there
could not well be a serious question. If France wanted a mere soldier,
she already had the foremost in the world. Napoleon still alive, the
regency would be only another name for his continued rule; the
Bourbons, and they alone, represented a principle. There was little
difficulty, therefore, in reaching the decision not to treat with
Napoleon Bonaparte or with any member of his family.</p>

<p>This was the great schemer's first stroke; his second was equally
brilliant: the servile senate was appointed to create a provisional
government and to construct a new constitution, to be guaranteed by
the allies. That body, however obsequious, was still French; even the
extreme radicals, as represented by Lainé of Bordeaux, had to
acknowledge this. The new and subservient administration was at work
within twenty-four hours; Talleyrand, with his two creatures, Dalberg
and Jaucourt; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> Montesquiou, the royalist; and Beurnonville, a
recalcitrant imperialist, constituting the executive commission. Two
days later the legislature was summoned, and seventy-nine deputies
responded. After considerable debate they pronounced Napoleon
overthrown for having violated the constitution. The municipal council
and the great imperial offices, with their magistrates, gave their
assent. The heart of the city appeared to have been transformed: on
the street, at the theater, everywhere the white Bourbon cockades and
ribbons burst forth like blossoms in a premature spring. But outside
the focus of agitation, and in the suburbs, the populace murmured, and
sometimes exhibited open discontent. In proportion to the distance
west and south, the country was correspondingly imperial, obeying the
imperial regency now established at Blois, which was summoning
recruits, issuing stirring proclamations, and keeping up a brave show.
In a way, therefore, France for the moment had three governments, that
of the allies, that of the regency, and that of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>When, in the latest hours of March thirtieth, Napoleon met Belliard,
and heard the disastrous report of what had happened, he gave full
vent to a frightful outburst of wrath. As he said himself in calmer
moments, such was his anger at that time, that he never seemed to have
known anger before. Forgetful of all his own shortcomings, he raged
against others with a fury bordering on insanity, and could find no
language vile or blasphemous enough wherewith to stigmatize Joseph and
Clarke. In utter self-abandonment, he demanded a carriage. There were
noise and bustle in the stable. With a choked, hoarse voice the
seeming maniac called peremptorily for haste. No vehicle appeared.
Probably Caulaincourt had dared to cross his Emperor's command for the
sake of his Emperor's safety. Finally Napoleon strode forth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
into the darkness toward Paris. Questioning and storming as he walked,
he denounced his two marshals for their haste in surrendering. His
attendants reasoned in vain until, a mile beyond La Cour de France,
Mortier's vanguard was met marching away under the terms of the
convention, and Napoleon knew that he was face to face with doom; to
advance farther would mean imprisonment or worse. General Flahaut was
therefore sent to seek Marmont's advice, and Caulaincourt hurried away
to secure an audience with the Czar. There were still wild hopes which
would not die. Perhaps the capitulation was not yet signed, perhaps
Caulaincourt could gain time if nothing else, perhaps by sounding the
tocsin and illuminating the town the populace and national guard would
be led to rise and aid the army. The reply from Marmont came as
swiftly as only discouraging news can come; the situation, he said,
was hopeless, the public depressed by the flight of the court, the
national guard worthless; he was coming in with the twenty thousand
troops still left to himself and Mortier. Napoleon, now calm and
collected, issued careful orders for the two marshals to take position
between the Essonne and the Seine, their left on the former stream,
their right on the latter, the whole position protected by these
rivers on the flanks, and by the Yonne in the rear. It was clear there
was to be a great battle under the walls of Paris. Macdonald was the
only general who advised it; Berthier, Drouot, Belliard, Flahaut, and
Gourgaud all wished to return into Lorraine; but the divisions were
coming in swiftly, and in the short midnight hour before returning to
Fontainebleau, Napoleon's decision was taken.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of April first the Emperor rode from Fontainebleau to
Marmont's headquarters. While he was in the very act of
congratulating Marmont on his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> gallantry, the commissioners
who had signed the capitulation arrived and opened their budget of
news. They told of the formal entry by the allies, of their resolution
not to treat with Napoleon, and declared that the white cockade of the
Bourbons was everywhere visible. Napoleon grew pensive and somber as
he listened, and then, almost without speaking, rode sadly back to
Fontainebleau. Next morning he was cheerful again, and as he stepped
into the White Horse court of the palace at the hour of guard-mounting
two battalions cheered him enthusiastically. His step was elastic, his
countenance lighted with the old fire; the onlookers said, "It is the
Napoleon of Potsdam and Schönbrunn." But in the afternoon Caulaincourt
returned, and the sky seemed darkened; the Czar had listened to the
envoy's eloquence only so far as to take into consideration once again
the question of peace with the Empire under a regency; as a condition
antecedent, Napoleon must abdicate.</p>

<p>The stricken man could not hear his faithful servant's report with
equanimity. He restrained his violent impulses, but used harsh words.
Soon it seemed as if ideas of a strange and awful form were mastering
him, the gloomy interview was ended, and the Emperor dismissed his
minister. For such a disease as his there was no remedy but action;
next morning two divisions, one each of the old and young guard,
arrived, and they were drawn up for review. Napoleon, in splendid garb
and with a brilliant suite, in which were two marshals, Ney and
Moncey, went through the ceremony. At its close he gathered the
officers present into a group, and explained the situation in his old
incisive phrase and vibrating tones, closing with the words: "In a few
days I am going to attack Paris; can I count on you?" There was dead
silence. "Am I right?" rang out, in a final exhausting effort, the
moving call of the great actor. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> Then at last came the hearty,
ringing response so breathlessly expected. "They were silent," said
General Petit in gentle tones, "because it seemed needless to reply."
Napoleon continued: "We will show them if the French nation be master
in their own house, that if we have long been masters in the dwellings
of others we will always be so in our own." As the officers scattered
to their posts and repeated the "little corporal's" words, the old
"growlers," as men had come to call the veterans of the Empire, gave
another cheer. The bands played the two great hymns of victory, the
"Marseillaise" and the "Chant du Départ," as the ranks moved away.</p>

<p>Napoleon must now have certain clear conceptions. Except Mortier,
Drouot, and Gérard, his great officers were disaffected; but the
ambitious minor generals were still his devoted slaves. The army was
thoroughly imperialist, partly because they represented the nation as
a whole, partly because they were under the Emperor's spell. Of such
troops he appeared to have at hand sixty thousand, distributed as
follows: Marmont, twelve thousand five hundred; Mortier, six thousand;
Macdonald, two thousand seven hundred; Oudinot, five thousand five
hundred; Gérard, three thousand; Ney, two thousand three hundred;
Drouot, nine thousand; and about eleven thousand six hundred guard and
other cavalry. Besides these, there were sixteen hundred Poles, two
thousand two hundred and fifty recruits, and fifteen hundred men in
the garrisons of Fontainebleau and Mélun. Farther away were
considerable forces in Sens, Tours, Blois, and Orléans, eight thousand
in all; and still farther the armies of Soult, Suchet, Augereau, and
Maison. Although the allies had lost nine thousand men before Paris,
they had quickly called up reinforcements, and had about a hundred and
forty thousand men in readiness to fight. This situation may not have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> been entirely discouraging to the devotee of a dark destiny,
to which as a hapless worshiper he had lately commenced to give the
name of Providence. Be that as it may, when Macdonald arrived on the
morning of the fourth the dispositions for battle had been carefully
studied and arranged; every corps was ordered to its station. As
usual, Napoleon appeared about noon for the ceremony of
guard-mounting, and the troops acclaimed him as usual. But a few paces
distant from him stood the marshals and higher generals in a little
knot, their heads close bunched, their tongues running, their glances
averted. From out of this group rang the thunderous voice of Ney:
"Nothing but the abdication can draw us out of this." Napoleon
started, regained his self-control, pretended not to hear the crushing
menace, and withdrew to his work-room.</p>

<p>Concurrent with the resolve of the marshals at Fontainebleau ran the
actual treason of one who alone was more important to Napoleon's cause
than all of them. "I am ready to leave, with my troops, the army of
the Emperor Napoleon on the following conditions, of which I demand
from you a written guaranty," are the startling words from a letter of
Marmont to the Czar, dated the previous day. On April first agents of
the provisional government had made arrangements with a discredited
nobleman named Maubreuil for the assassination of Napoleon; the next
day Schwarzenberg introduced into the French lines newspapers and
copies of a proclamation explaining that the action of the senate and
of all France had released the soldiers from their oaths. Marmont
forwarded the documents he received to Berthier, and while most of the
officers flung their copies away in contemptuous scorn, some read and
pondered. On April third an emissary from Schwarzenberg appeared at
Marmont's headquarters, and what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> he said was spoken to
willing ears. Still under the influence of the homage he had received
in Paris, the vain marshal saw himself repeating the rôle of Monk; he
beheld France at peace, prosperity restored, social order
reëstablished, and himself extolled as a true patriot&mdash;all this if
only he pursued the easy line of self-interest, whereby he would not
merely retain his duchy, but also secure the new honors and emoluments
which would be showered on him. So he yielded on condition that his
troops should withdraw honorably into Normandy, and that Napoleon
should be allowed to enjoy life and liberty within circumscribed
limits fixed by the allied powers and France. Next morning, the
fourth, came Schwarzenberg's assent, and Marmont at once set about
suborning his officers; at four in the afternoon arrived an embassy
from Fontainebleau on its way to Paris. The officers composing it
desired to see Marmont.</p>

<p>The informal meeting held in the courtyard at Fontainebleau was a
historical event. Its members chatted about the course taken by the
senate, about Caulaincourt's mission, and discussed in particular the
suggestion of abdication. The marshals and great generals, long since
disgusted with campaigning, wounded in their dignity by the Emperor's
rebukes, and attributing their recent failures to the wretched quality
of the troops assigned to them, were eager for peace, and yearned to
enjoy their hard-earned fortunes. They caught at the seductive idea
presented by Caulaincourt. The abdication of Napoleon would mean the
perpetuation of the Empire. The Empire would be not merely peace, but
peace with what war had gained; to wit, the imperial court and
society, the preservation and enjoyment of estates, the continuity of
processes which had done so much to regenerate France and make her a
modern nation. The prospect was irresistible, and Ney only expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span> the grim determination of his colleagues when he gave the
watchword so unexpectedly at the mounting of the guard. When Napoleon
entered his cabinet he found there Berthier, Maret, Caulaincourt, and
Bertrand. Concealing his agitation, he began the routine of such
familiar labors as impend on the eve of battle. Almost instantly
hurrying footsteps were heard in the corridor, the door was burst
open, and on the threshold stood Ney, Lefebvre, Oudinot, and
Macdonald. The leader of the company quailed an instant under the
Emperor's gaze, and then gruffly demanded if there were news from
Paris. No, was the reply&mdash;a deliberate falsehood, since the decree of
the senate had arrived the night before. "Well, then, I have some,"
roared Ney, and told the familiar facts.</p>

<p>At Nogent, six weeks earlier, Ney and Oudinot had endeavored to bully
Napoleon in a similar way; then they were easily cowed. But now
Napoleon's manner was conciliatory and his speech argumentative. Long
and eloquently he set forth his situation. Enumerating all the forces
immediately and remotely at his disposal, describing minutely the plan
of attack which Macdonald had stamped with his approval, explaining
the folly of the course pursued by the allies, contrasting the perils
of their situation with the advantages of his own, he sought to
justify his assurance of victory. The eloquence of a Napoleon, calm,
collected, clear, but pleading for the power which was dearer to him
than life, can only be imagined. But his arguments fell on deaf ears;
not one of his audience gave any sign of emotion. Macdonald was the
only one present not openly committed, and he too was sullen; during
the last twenty-four hours he had received, through Marmont, a letter
from Beurnonville, the contents of which, though read to Napoleon
then and there, have not been transmitted to posterity. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> What
happened or what was said thereafter is far from certain, so
conflicting and so biased are the accounts of those present.
Contemporaries thought that in this crisis, when Ney declared the army
would obey its officers and would not march to Paris in obedience to
the Emperor, there were menacing gestures which betrayed a more or
less complete purpose of assassination on the part of some. If so,
Napoleon was never greater; for, commanding a calm by his dignified
self-restraint, he dismissed the faithless officers one and all. They
went, and he was left alone with Caulaincourt to draw up the form of
his abdication.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Napoleon sincerely and dearly loved his
"growlers"; there is no doubt that with grim humor he constantly
circumvented and used them for his own ends; even in his agony he
contemplated a course which, leaving them convinced of their success,
would yet render their action of no effect. After a short conference
with his minister he took a pen and wrote: "The allied powers having
declared the Emperor Napoleon to be the sole obstacle to the
establishment of peace in Europe, and since the Emperor cannot
assuredly, without violating his oath, surrender <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> any one of
the departments which were united with France when he ascended the
throne, the Emperor Napoleon declares himself ready to abdicate and
leave France, even to lay down his life for the welfare of his country
and for the preservation of the rights of his son the King, of the
Empress-regent, and of the laws and institutions, which shall be
subject to no change until the definite conclusion of peace and while
foreign armies stand upon our soil."</p>

<p>But these words carried too plainly a meaning which was not intended
to be conspicuous, and the paper, as finally written and executed,
runs as follows: "The allied powers having declared the Emperor
Napoleon to be the sole obstacle to the reëstablishment of peace in
Europe, the Emperor Napoleon, faithful to his oath, declares that he
is ready to descend from the throne, to leave France, and even to lay
down his life for the good of the country, [which is] inseparable from
the rights of his son, from those of the Empress's regency, and from
the laws of the Empire." Who should constitute the embassy to present
the document to the Czar? Caulaincourt, of course, would necessarily
be one; Ney, dangerous if thwarted, must be the second; and the third?
Marmont certainly, was Napoleon's first thought, and he ordered full
powers to be made out for him. But on second thought he felt that his
aide-de-camp in Egypt, his trusted friend from then onward, his
confidential adviser, "brought up in his tent," as he said, might
injure the cause as being too certainly influenced by personal
considerations. Macdonald, therefore, was named in his stead. The
embassy should, however, pass by Essonnes, and if Marmont desired to
go he might send back for his credentials.</p>

<p>This was the company which, arriving about four in the afternoon at
Marmont's headquarters, presented <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> Napoleon's message. The
busy conspirator was stunned, but he had already won at least five of
his generals&mdash;Souham, Merlin, Digeon, Ledru des Essarts, and
Megnadier, his chief of staff; the tide of treason was in full flow,
and could not be stemmed. Should the Czar assent to the regency, where
would Marmont be? Or, on the other hand, should Napoleon learn the
truth, there was no question but that a few hours might see the
emulator of Monk a corpse. In quick decision, the traitorous marshal
confessed the steps already taken, and then at the loud cry of
reprobation with which his statement was met, he falsely asserted that
he was not yet committed, and demanded to join the embassy. The
others, willing to remove their colleague from further temptation,
assented; and Souham was left in command, with strict injunctions to
inform the troops of Napoleon's abdication, but to take no further
steps. At Schwarzenberg's headquarters Marmont found means to betray
the situation to that general. The Austrian, by Marmont's own account,
absolved his fellow-intriguer from all engagements so far made; but
somehow that very evening about nine Talleyrand knew the whole story,
and hastening, pale with terror, to Alexander's presence, poured out a
bitter remonstrance against the regency. The Czar listened, but
contemptuously dismissed the petitioner with the non-committal remark
that no one would repent having trusted him.</p>

<p>It was almost midnight when Alexander gave audience to the embassy.
Marmont was not of the number, having slunk away in guilty uneasiness
to await the event at Ney's house. To Caulaincourt, as the spokesman
of the Empire, the Czar listened attentively and sympathetically. He
now felt himself to have taken a false step when, five days earlier,
he had virtually assented to the restoration of the Bourbons. In the
interval <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> their cause had steadily grown more and more
unpopular; neither people nor soldiers, not even the national guard,
would give any declaration of adherence to the acts of the provisional
government; the imperial army, on the other hand, stood firm. His own
and Russia's honor having been redeemed, the earlier instincts of
hatred for absolutism had returned; the feeling that the Empire was
better for his purposes than any dynasty welled up as he listened to
Caulaincourt's powerful argument that France as a nation, and her
undivided army, alike desired the regency. In fact, the listener
wavered so much that, two days later, Ney and Macdonald asserted their
belief that at a certain instant their cause had been won.</p>

<p>But at two in the morning an aide-de-camp entered and spoke a few
words in Russian. The Czar gave a startled attention, and the officer
repeated his words. "Gentlemen," said the monarch, "you base your
claim on the unshaken attachment of the army to the imperial
government. The vanguard of Napoleon's army has just deserted. It is
at this moment within our lines." The news was true. The announcement
of Napoleon's abdication had spread consternation among Marmont's men,
and they were seriously demoralized. When a routine message came from
Fontainebleau requiring Souham's presence there, his guilty conscience
made him tremble; and when Gourgaud requested an interview the uneasy
general foresaw his own arrest and was terror-stricken. Summoning the
others who, like himself, were partly committed, he told his fears,
and the soldiers were ordered under arms. Toward midnight the march
began. Ignorant at first of whither they were going, the men were
silent; but finding themselves before long between two Austrian lines,
they hooted their officers. Thereupon they were told that they were
to fight beside <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> these same Austrians in defense of the
Empire, and, believing the lie, were reconciled.</p>

<p>Arriving finally at Versailles, and learning the truth, they mutinied;
but Marmont soon appeared, and partly cowed them, partly persuaded
them to bend before necessity. After learning of Souham's deed he had
hurried to the Czar's antechamber. In an adjoining room were assembled
the members of the provisional government. Like Marmont, they had
learned the result of Souham's efforts and had regained their
equanimity. After grasping the appalling fact that twelve thousand
men, the whole sixth corps, with arms and baggage, were prisoners
within the Austrian lines, of course there had been nothing left for
Caulaincourt and the marshals but to withdraw. With much embarrassment
the Czar promised an answer to their request on the following
afternoon. All knew that the knell of the Empire had struck. To the
waiting royalists it seemed a fit moment for pleasantry as the members
of the embassy came filing out with stony gaze. The thwarted
imperialists sternly repulsed their tormentors. Marmont breathed hard
as his colleagues passed without a glimpse of recognition, and
murmured: "I would give an arm if this had not happened." "An arm?
Sir, say your head," rejoined Macdonald, bitterly. For some time after
the first Restoration Marmont was a hero, but soon his vanity and true
character combined to bring out his conduct into clear view, and from
his title of Ragusa was coined the word "ragusade" as a synonym for
treason. During the "Hundred Days" his name was of course stricken
from the list of marshals. Loaded with honors in the second
Restoration, he proved a second time faithless, and in 1830 betrayed
his trust to the republicans. The people called him "Judas," and he
died in exile, honored by nobody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> There can be little doubt of Napoleon's conviction that his
offer to abdicate would be rejected by Alexander. No sooner was it
signed than, with his characteristic astuteness, he set about
preparing an alternative course. At once he despatched a messenger
requesting the Empress to send Champagny immediately to Dijon as an
ambassador to intercede with her father. Then, on April fourth, he
summoned a conclave of his officers to secure their assent to the
battle which he believed inevitable. It was the call to this meeting
which had stampeded Souham and his colleagues in desertion. The
greater officers being absent from Fontainebleau, the minor ones were
unanimous and hearty in their support of Napoleon's plans. But at the
very close of the session came the news of what had happened at
Essonnes. When finally assured of every detail, Napoleon took measures
at once to repair as best he could the breaches in his defense, saying
of Marmont quietly and without a sign of panic: "Unhappy man, he will
be more unhappy than I." Only a few days before he had declared to
Caulaincourt: "There are no longer any who play fair except my poor
soldiers and their officers that are neither princes nor dukes nor
counts. It is an awful thing to say, but it is true. Do you know what
I ought to do? Send all these noble lords of yesterday to sleep in
their beds of down, to strut about in their castles. I ought to rid
myself of these frondeurs, and begin the war once more with men of
youthful, unsullied courage." He was partly prepared, therefore, even
for the defection of Marmont. Next morning, on the fifth, was issued
the ablest proclamation ever penned by him; at noon the veterans from
Spain were reviewed, and in the afternoon began the movements
necessary to array beyond the Loire what remained of the army and
rally it about the seat of imperial government. But at nine the
embassy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> returned from Paris with its news&mdash;the Czar had
refused to accept the abdication; the senate was about to proclaim
Louis XVIII; Napoleon was to reign thereafter over the little isle of
Elba. To this the undaunted Emperor calmly rejoined that war
henceforth offered nothing worse than peace, and began at once to
explain his plans.</p>

<p>But he was interrupted&mdash;exactly how we cannot tell; for, though the
embassy returned as it left, in a body, the memoirs of each member
strive to convey the impression that it was he alone who said and did
everything. If only the narrative attributed to Caulaincourt were of
undoubted authenticity, cumulative evidence might create certitude;
but it is not. The sorry tale of what probably occurred makes clear
that all three were now royalists more or less ardent, for in passing
they had concluded a truce with Schwarzenberg on that basis. Macdonald
asserts that his was the short and brutal response to Napoleon's
exhibition of his plans; to wit, that they must have an abdication
without conditions. Ney was quite as savage, declaring that the
confidence of the army was gone. Napoleon at first denounced such
mutiny, but then, with seeming resignation, promised an answer next
day. He did not yet know that in secret convention the generals were
resolving not to obey the orders issued for the morrow; but as the
door closed behind the marshals the mind so far clear seemed suddenly
eclipsed, and murmuring, "These men have neither heart nor bowels; I
am conquered less by fortune than by the egotism and ingratitude of my
companions in arms," the great, homeless citizen of the world sank
into utter dejection.</p>

<p>It appears to have been a fixed purpose with Napoleon never to fall
alive into his enemy's hands. Although they acted under legal forms,
yet some European monarchs <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> of the eighteenth century were no
more trustworthy in dealing with foes than their great prototype
Julius Cæsar in his faithlessness to a certain canton of the
Helvetians. They did not display sufficient surprise when enemies were
assassinated. Since 1808 the European colossus had worn about his neck
as a kind of amulet a little bag which was said to contain a deadly
poison, one of the salts of prussic acid. During the night, when the
terrors of a shaken reason overpowered him, he swallowed the drug.
Whether it had lost its efficacy, or whether the agitated victim of
melancholy did not take the entire dose, in either case the effects
were imperfect. Instead of oblivion came agony, and his valet, rushing
to his master's bedside at the sound of a bitter cry, claimed to catch
the words: "Marmont has struck me the final blow! Unhappy man, I loved
him! Berthier's desertion has broken my heart! My old friends, my
comrades in arms!" Ivan, the Emperor's body physician, was summoned,
and administered an antidote; the spasm was allayed, and after a short
sleep reason resumed her seat. It is related in the memoirs of
Caulaincourt, and probably with a sort of Homeric truth, that when the
minister was admitted in the early morning, Napoleon's "wan and sunken
eyes seemed struggling to recall the objects round about; a universe
of torture was revealed in the vaguely desolate look." Napoleon is
reported as saying: "God did not will it. I could not die. Why did
they not let me die? It is not the loss of the throne that makes
existence unendurable; my military career suffices for the glory of a
single man. Do you know what is more difficult to bear than the
reverses of fortune? It is the baseness, the horrible ingratitude, of
men. Before such acts of cowardice, before the shamelessness of their
egotism, I have turned away my head in disgust and have come to
regard my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> life with horror.... Death is rest.... Rest at
last.... What I have suffered for twenty days no one can understand."</p>

<p>What throws some shadow on this account is the fact that on the
following morning Napoleon appeared outwardly well and perfectly calm
when he assembled his marshals and made a final appeal. It is certain,
from the testimony of his secretary and his physician, that he had
been violently ill, but the sobriety of the remaining chronicle is to
be doubted. Possibly, too, the empty sachet had contained a
preparation of opium intended to relieve sharp attacks like that at
Pirna; but in view of the second attempt at suicide made after
Waterloo, this is not likely. Yet the circumstances may easily have
been exaggerated; for the evident motive of what has been called the
imperial legend is to heighten all the effects in the Napoleonic
picture. Whatever was the truth as to that gloomy night, Napoleon's
appeal next morning, though eloquent, was in vain; the marshals were
unshaken in their determination, though less bitter and violent in
their language. "You deserve repose," were the Emperor's last words to
them; "well, then, take it." Thereupon the act of unconditional
abdication was written in these words: "The allied powers having
declared the Emperor Napoleon to be the sole obstacle to the
reëstablishment of peace in Europe, the Emperor Napoleon, faithful to
his oath, declares that for himself and his heirs he renounces the
thrones of France and of Italy, because there is no personal sacrifice
which he is not ready to make for the welfare of the nation." These
last words were, after some consideration, erased, and the phrase "in
the interest of France" was substituted for them. Some think, and it
may well be true, that this change of form, taken in connection with
Napoleon's calmness, was another proof of his deep <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> purpose.
Unable to thwart his "growlers," he may have recollected that once
before he had crossed the Mediterranean to give a feeble government
full scope for its own destruction. France might easily recall her
favorite son in her own interest. He was scarcely more than
forty-four, a young man still, and this he probably recalled as he
made ready to play a new rôle.</p>

<p>Armed with the document necessary to secure his pardon, Ney hurried
back to the capital. The elderly, well-meaning, but obtuse Louis XVIII
was immediately proclaimed king by the senate. Having "learned
nothing, and forgotten nothing," he accepted the throne, making
certain concessions to the new France, sufficient, as he hoped, to
secure at least the momentary support of the people. The haste to join
the white standard made by men on whom Napoleon's adventurous career
had heaped honor and wealth is unparalleled in history. Jourdan,
Augereau, Maison, Lagrange, Nansouty, Oudinot, Kellermann, Lefebvre,
Hulin, Milhaud, Latour-Maubourg, Ségur, Berthier, Belliard&mdash;such were
the earliest names. Among the soldiers near by some bowed to the new
order, but among the garrisons there was such widespread mutiny that
royalist hate was kindled again and fanned to white heat by the scoffs
and jeers of the outraged men. Their behavior was the outward sign of
a temper not universal, of course, but very common among the people.
At Paris both the King and the King's brother were cheered on their
formal entry, but many discriminating onlookers prophesied that the
Bourbons could not remain long.</p>

<p>Fully aware that Napoleon was yet a power in France, and challenged by
the marshals to display a chivalric spirit in providing for the
welfare of their former monarch, Alexander gave full play to his
generous impulses. His first suggestion was that his fallen foe
should accept <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> a home and complete establishment in Russia;
but this would have been to ignore the other members of the coalition.
It was determined finally to provide the semblance of an empire, the
forms of state, and an imperial income, and to make the former Emperor
the guest of all Europe. The idea was quixotic, but Napoleon was not a
prisoner; he had done nothing worthy of degradation, and throughout
the civilized world he was still regarded by vast numbers as the
savior of European society, who had fallen into the hands of cruel
oppressors. The paper which was finally drawn up was a treaty between
Napoleon, for the time and purposes of the instrument a private
citizen, as one party, and the four sovereign states of Austria,
Prussia, Russia, and England as the other. It had, therefore, no
sanction except the public opinion of France and the good faith of
those who executed it, the former being bound by her allies to a
contract made by them. It was France which was to pay Napoleon two
millions of francs a year, and leave him to reign undisturbed over
Elba; the allies granted Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla as a realm in
perpetuity to Maria Louisa and her heirs, through the King of Rome, as
her successors. The agreement was unique, but so were the
circumstances which brought it to pass. There was but one important
protest, and that was made by Castlereagh in regard to the word
Napoleon and the imperial style! His protest was vain, but to this day
many among the greatest of his countrymen persistently employ
"Bonaparte" in speaking of the greater, and "Napoleon" in designating
the lesser, of the two men who have ruled France as emperors.</p>

<p>Four commissioners, one from each of the powers, proceeded to
Fontainebleau. They were careful to treat Napoleon with the
consideration due to an emperor. To all he was courteous, except to
the representative of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> Prussia, Count Truchsess-Waldburg,
whose presence he declared unnecessary, since there were to be no
Prussian troops on the southern road toward Elba. With Colonel
Campbell, the British commissioner, he was most friendly, conversing
enthusiastically with the Scotch officer about the Scotch poet known
as Ossian. What was particularly admired in his remarkable outpourings
was their warlike tone. As the preparations for departure went
forward, it became clear that of all the imperial dignitaries only
Bertrand and Drouot would accompany the exile. The others he dismissed
with characteristic and appropriate farewells: to Caulaincourt he
assigned a gift of five hundred thousand francs from the treasure at
Blois; Constant, the valet, and Rustan, the Mameluke, were dismissed
at their own desire, but not empty-handed. For his line of travel, and
for a hundred baggage-wagons loaded with books, furniture, and objects
of art, Napoleon stipulated with the utmost nicety and persistence.
With every hour he showed greater and greater anxiety for his personal
safety. Indifferent to life but a few short days before, he was now
timid and over-anxious. If he had been playing a part and pondering
what in a few years, perhaps months, his life and person might again
be worth in European politics, he could not have been more painstaking
as to measures for his personal safety. The stoic could have recourse
to the bowl, the eighteenth-century enthusiast must live and hope to
the last. Napoleon seems to have struggled for the union of both
characters. "They blame me that I can outlive my fall," he remarked.
"Wrongfully.... It is much more courageous to survive unmerited bad
fortune." Only once he seemed overpowered, being observed, as he sat
at table, to strike his forehead and murmur: "God, is it possible?"
Sometimes, too, he appeared to be lost in reverie, and when addressed
started like one awakened from a dream. All <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> was ready on the
twentieth; but the Empress, who by the terms of the "treaty" was to
accompany her consort as far as the harbor of St. Tropez, did not
appear. Napoleon declared that she had been kidnapped, and refused to
stir, threatening to withdraw his abdication. Koller, the Austrian
commissioner, assured him of the truth, that she had resolved of her
free will not to be present. In the certainty that all was over, the
Empress had determined to take refuge with her father, and the
imperial government at Blois had dispersed, Joseph and Jerome flying
to Switzerland.</p>

<p>The announcement staggered Napoleon, but he replied with words
destined to have great significance: "Very well; I shall remain
faithful to my promise; but if I have new reasons to complain, I shall
consider myself absolved." Further, he touched on various topics as if
seeking to talk against time, remarking that Francis had impiously
sought the dissolution of his daughter's marriage; that Russia and
Prussia had made Austria's position dangerous; that the Czar and
Frederick William had shown little delicacy in visiting Maria Louisa
at Rambouillet; that he himself was no usurper; and that he had been
wrong not to make peace at Prague or Dresden. Then, suddenly changing
tone and topic, he asked with interest what would occur if Elba
refused to accept him. Koller thought he might still take refuge in
England. Napoleon rejoined that he had thought of that; but, having
always sought to do England harm, would the English make him welcome?
Koller replied that, as all the projects against her welfare had come
to naught, England would feel no bitterness. Finally, about noon
Napoleon descended into the courtyard, where the few grenadiers of the
old guard were drawn up. The officers, commissioned and
non-commissioned, were called forward, and in a few touching words
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> former leader thanked all who had remained true for
their loyalty. With their aid he could have continued the war beyond
the Loire, but he had preferred to sacrifice his personal interests to
those of France. "Continue to serve France," runs the Napoleonic text
of this fine address: but the commissioners thought they heard "to
serve the sovereign which the nation has chosen." He could have ended
his life, he went on to say, but he wished to live and record for
posterity the great deeds of his warriors. Then he embraced Petit, the
commanding officer, and, snatching to his breast the imperial eagle,
his standard in so many glorious battles, he pressed it to his lips,
and entered the waiting carriage. A swelling sob burst from the ranks,
and tears bedewed the weather-beaten cheeks of men who had not wept
for years.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1814-15</p>

<p>Napoleon's journey to Elba was a series of disenchantments. As has
been said, he had stipulated in his "treaty" that the Empress should
accompany him to St. Tropez, where he was to embark. Her absence, he
persisted in declaring, was explicable only by forced detention; and
he again talked of withdrawing his abdication at this breach of the
engagements made by the allies. But he grew more composed, and the
journey was sufficiently comfortable as far as Lyons. Occasionally
during that portion of it there were outbursts of good feeling from
those who stopped to see his train pass by. But in descending the
Rhone there was a marked change. As the Provençals had been the
radicals of the Revolution, so now they were the devotees of the
Restoration. The flood of disreputable calumny had broken loose: men
said the Emperor's mother was a loose woman, his father a butcher, he
himself but a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> bastard, his true name Nicholas. "Down with
Bonaparte! down with Nicholas!" was too often the derisive shout as he
traversed the villages. Maubreuil, the hired assassin, was hurrying
from Paris with a desperate band, ostensibly to recover crown jewels
or government funds which might be among Napoleon's effects. Recalling
Alexander's boast that his best servants had been found among the
assassins of his father, and recollecting that Francis sighed to
Metternich for Napoleon's exile to a far-distant land, Elba being too
near to France and to Europe, it is conceivable that Talleyrand might
reckon on the moral support of the dynasties in conniving at
Napoleon's assassination. Had he forgotten the murder of Enghien?
Probably not; but his conscience was not over-tender. Near Valence, on
April twenty-fourth, the imperial procession met Augereau's carriage.
The arch-republican of Napoleon's earlier career had given his
adhesion to the new government, and had been retained in office. He
alighted, the ex-Emperor likewise: the latter exhibited all the
ordinary forms of politeness, the former studiously disdained them.
Napoleon, with nice irony, asked if the general were on his way to
court. The thrust went home, but in a gruff retort Augereau, using the
insulting "thou," declared with considerable embarrassment that he
cared no more for the Bourbons than for Napoleon; that he had no
motive for his conduct except love for his country.</p>

<p>Partly by good fortune, partly by good management, the cortège avoided
the infuriated bands who, in various places, had sworn to take the
fallen Emperor's life. At Avignon his escape was almost miraculous.
Near Orgon a mob of royalists beset the carriage, and Napoleon shrank
in pallid terror behind Bertrand, cowering there until the immediate
danger was removed by his Russian escort. A few miles out he donned a
postilion's uniform <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> and rode post through the town. At
Saint-Cannat he would not touch a morsel of food for fear of poison.
Rumors of the bitter feeling prevalent at Aix led him for further
protection to clothe one of his aides in his own too familiar garb. In
that town he was violently ill, somewhat as he had been at
Fontainebleau. The attack yielded easily to remedies, and the Prussian
commissioner asserted that it was due to a loathsome disease.
Thereafter the hounded fugitive wore an Austrian uniform, and sat in
the Austrian commissioner's carriage; thus disguised, the Emperor of
Elba seemed to feel secure. From Luc onward the company was protected
by Austrian hussars; but in spite of these military jailers, mob
violence became stronger from day to day in each successive town.
Napoleon grew morbid, and the line of travel was changed from the
direction of St. Tropez to that of Fréjus in order to avoid the
ever-increasing danger. The only alleviation in the long line of ills
was a visit from his light and giddy but affectionate sister Pauline,
the Princess Borghese, who comforted him and promised to share his
exile. At length Fréjus was reached, and Napoleon resumed his
composure as he saw an English frigate and a French brig lying in the
harbor. Perhaps the beautiful view recalled to an outcast monarch the
return, in 1799, of one General Bonaparte, who had landed on the same
shore to overthrow the Directory. If not, it must have been due to
unwonted dejection or dark despair.</p>

<p>Again Napoleon remarked a breach of his treaty. He was to have sailed
from St. Tropez in a corvette; here was only a brig. Accordingly, as
if to mark an intentional slight, in reality for his safety and
comfort, he asked and obtained permission to embark on the English
frigate, the <i>Undaunted</i>, as the guest of her captain. The promised
corvette was at St. Tropez awaiting its passenger, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> but the
hasty change of plan had made it impossible to bring her around in
time. Possibly for this reason, too, the baggage of Napoleon had been
much diminished in quantity; and of this he complained also, as being
a breach of his treaty. His farewell to the Russian and Prussian
commissioners was brief and dignified; the Austrian hussars paid full
military honors to the party; and as the Emperor, accompanied by the
English and Austrian commissioners, embarked, a salvo of twenty-four
guns rang out from the <i>Undaunted</i>. Already he had begun to eulogize
England and her civilization, and to behave as if throwing himself on
the good faith of an English gentleman, exactly as a defeated knight
would throw himself on the chivalric courtesy of his conqueror. This
appearance of distinguished treatment heightened his
self-satisfaction. His attendants said that once again he was "all
emperor."</p>

<p>It was a serious blow when, on passing aboard ship, he discovered that
the salutes had been in recognition of the commissioners, and that the
polite but decided Captain Ussher was determined to treat his
illustrious guest with the courtesy due to a private gentleman, and
with that alone. Although chafing at times during the voyage against
the restrictions of naval discipline, Napoleon submitted gracefully,
and wore a subdued air. This was his first contact with English
customs: sometimes they interested him; frequently, as in the matter
of after-dinner amusements and Sunday observance, they irritated him,
and then with a contemptuous petulance he withdrew to his cabin. In
conversation with Koller, the Austrian commissioner, he once referred
to his conduct in disguising himself on the road to Fréjus as
pusillanimous, and admitted in vulgar language that he had made an
indecent display of himself. He was convinced that all the dreadful
scenes through which he had passed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> were the work of Bourbon
emissaries. In general his talk was a running commentary on the past,
a well-calculated prattle in which, with apparent spontaneity and
ingenuousness, interpretations were placed on his conduct which were
thoroughly novel. This was the beginning of a series of historical
commentaries lasting, with interruptions, to the end of his life.
There is throughout a unity of purpose in the explication and
embellishment of history which will be considered later. On May fourth
the <i>Undaunted</i> cast anchor in the harbor of Porto Ferrajo.</p>

<p>Elba was an island divided against itself, there being both
imperialists and royalists among its inhabitants, and a considerable
party which desired independence. By representing that Napoleon had
brought with him fabulous sums, the Austrian and English commissioners
easily won the Elbans to a fervor of loyalty for their new emperor.
Before nightfall of the fourth the court was established, and the new
administration began its labors. After mastering the resources and
needs of his pygmy realm, the Emperor began at once to deploy all his
powers, mending the highways, fortifying the strategic points, and
creating about the nucleus of four hundred guards which were sent from
Fontainebleau an efficient little army of sixteen hundred men. His
expenses were regulated to the minutest detail, the salt-works and
iron-mines, which were the bulwarks of Elban prosperity, began at once
to increase their output, and taxation was regulated with scrupulous
nicety. By that supereminent virtue of the French burgher, good
management, the island was made almost independent of the remnants of
the Tuileries treasure, the sum of about five million francs, which
Napoleon had brought from France. The same powers which had swayed a
world operated with equal success in a sphere almost microscopic by
comparison. To many this appeared a sorry commentary on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span>
human grandeur, but the great exile did not intend to sink into a
contemptible lethargy. If the future had aught in store for him, his
capacities must have exercise and their bearings be kept smooth by
use. The Princess Borghese had been separated from her second husband
soon after the marriage, and since 1810 she had lived an exile from
Paris, having been banished for impertinent conduct to the Empress.
But she cherished no malice, and before long, according to promise,
she arrived and took up her abode as her brother's companion. Madame
Mère, though distant in prosperity, came likewise to soothe her son in
adversity. The intercepted letters of the former prove her to have
been at least as loose in her life at Elba as ever before, but they do
not afford a sufficient basis for the scandals concerning her
relations with Napoleon which were founded upon them and industriously
circulated at the court of Louis XVIII. The shameful charge, though
recently revived and ingeniously supported, appears to have no
adequate foundation.</p>

<p>Napoleon's economies were rendered not merely expedient, but
imperative, by the fact that none of the moneys from France were
forthcoming which had been promised in his treaty with the powers.
After a short stay Koller frankly stated that in his opinion they
never would be paid, and departed. The island swarmed with Bourbon
spies, and the only conversation in which Napoleon could indulge
himself unguardedly was with Sir Neil Campbell, the English
representative, or with the titled English gentlemen who gratified
their curiosity by visiting him. During the summer heat, when the
court was encamped on the heights at Marciana for refreshment, there
appeared a mysterious lady with her child. Both were well received and
kindly treated, but they withdrew themselves entirely from the public
gaze. Common <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> rumor said it was the Empress, but this was not
true; it was the Countess Walewska, with one of the two sons she bore
her host, whom she still adored. They remained but a few days, and
departed as mysteriously as they had come. Base females thronged the
precincts of the imperial residence, openly struggling for Napoleon's
favor as they had so far never dared to do; success too frequently
attended their efforts.</p>

<p>But the one woman who should have been at his side was absent.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15"><span class="smaller">[15]</span></a> It
is certain that she made an honest effort to come, and apartments were
prepared for her reception in the little palace at Porto Ferrajo. Her
father, however, thwarted her at every turn, and finally she was a
virtual prisoner at Schönbrunn. So manifest was the restraint that her
grandmother Caroline, Queen of the Two Sicilies, cried out in
indignation: "If I were in the place of Maria Louisa, I would tie the
sheets of my bed to the window-frame and flee." Committed to the
charge of the elegant and subtle Neipperg, a favorite chamberlain whom
she had first seen at Dresden, she was plied with such insidious wiles
that at last her slender moral fibre was entirely broken down, and she
fell a victim to his charms. As late as August, Napoleon received
impassioned letters from her; then she grew formal and cold; at last,
under Metternich's urgency, she ceased to write at all. Her French
attendant, Méneval, managed to convey the whole sad story to her
husband; but the Emperor was incredulous, and hoped against hope until
December. Then only he ceased from his incessant and urgent appeals.</p>

<p>The number of visitors to Elba was sometimes as high as three hundred
in a single day. Among these were a few English, fewer French, but
many Italians. As time passed the heaviness of the Austrian yoke had
begun <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> to gall the people of Napoleon's former kingdom, and
considerable numbers from among them, remembering the mild Eugène with
longing, joined in an extensive though feeble conspiracy to restore
Napoleon to the throne of Italy. Lucien returned to Rome in order to
foster the movement, and Murat, observing with unease the general
faithlessness of the great powers in small matters, began to tremble
for the security of his own seat. With them and others Napoleon
appears to have corresponded regularly. He felt himself entirely freed
from the obligations he had taken at Fontainebleau, for he was sure
the people of southern France had been instigated to take his life by
royalist agents, and while one term after another passed, not a cent
was paid of the promised pension; his own fortune, therefore, was
steadily melting away. For months he behaved as if really determined
to make Elba his "isle of repose," as he designated it just before
landing; but under such provocations his temper changed. The
corner-stone of his treaty was his complete sovereignty; otherwise the
paper was merely a promise without any sanction, not even that of
international law. This perfect sovereignty had been recognized by the
withdrawal of all the commissioners as such, Campbell insisting that
he remained merely as an ambassador.</p>

<p>In a treaty concluded on May thirtieth between Louis XVIII and the
powers of the coalition, the boundaries of France were fixed
substantially as they had been in 1792, and the destiny of the lands
brought under her sway by the Revolution and by Napoleon was to be
determined by a European congress. This body met on November first,
1814, at Vienna. It was soon evident that the four powers of the
coalition were to outdo Napoleon's extreme endeavors in their reckless
disposition of European territories. Before the close of the month,
however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> Talleyrand, by his adroit manipulations and his
conjurings with the sacrosanct word "legitimacy," had made himself the
moving spirit of the congress, and had so inflamed the temper of both
Metternich and Castlereagh against the dictatorial attitude of Russia
and Prussia as to induce Austria and Great Britain to sign, on January
third, 1815, a secret treaty with France whereby the parties of the
first part bound themselves to resist the aggressiveness of the
Northern powers, and that by force if necessary. This restored France
to the position of a great power. By the middle of February the
Northern allies were brought to terms, and in return for their
concessions it was agreed that Murat was to be deposed. This spirit of
compromise menaced, or rather finally destroyed, the sovereignty of
Napoleon, petty as it was. On the charge of conspiring with Murat, he
could easily be removed from Elba, and deported to some more remote
spot from which he could exert no influence on European politics.</p>

<p>From the opening sessions of the congress there had been a general
consensus of opinion as to this course. As to the place opinions
varied. Castlereagh favored the Azores, but others the Cape Verde
islands; St. Helena, then well known as a place of call on the long
voyage to the Cape, had been suggested much earlier, even before Elba
was chosen, but when or by whom is not known. It is quite possible
that Wellington, who succeeded Castlereagh as English plenipotentiary
in February, may have mentioned the name; he had been there, and knew
it as almost the remotest spot of land in the world. The formal
proposition to that effect appears to have been made by the Prussian
cabinet. The congress took no definite action in the matter, but the
understanding was so clear and general that a proclamation to the
national guard was printed in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> "Moniteur" of March eighth,
1815, stating that measures had been taken at the Congress of Vienna
to remove Napoleon farther away. It was easy for everybody, including
the captive himself, to believe that, all the other articles of the
agreement at Fontainebleau having been violated, that which guaranteed
the sovereignty of Elba was equally worthless.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that Napoleon was fully aware of whatever was
proposed at Vienna, and it is absolutely certain that he was
thoroughly informed as to the changed state of public opinion in
France. Having promised a fairly liberal constitution as the price of
his throne, Louis XVIII, with colossal stupidity, undertook to ignore
the past and promulgated the charter as his own gracious act, done in
the nineteenth year of his reign! The upper chamber, or House of
Peers, was his creature, since he could create members at will. Feeble
in mind and body, he was unable to check the reactionary assumptions
of his family, who, having deserted their country, had returned to it
by the aid of invaders despised and feared by the nation. These and
the returning emigrants were provided with rich sinecures, and began
to talk of restoring estates to their rightful owners; in some cases
the possessors, on their death-beds, were intimidated into making such
restitution. The extreme clerical party began even to hamper the
ministry in its efforts to grant the freedom of worship guaranteed by
the constitution. Secular business was forbidden on certain holy days,
and funeral masses were celebrated for Pichegru, Moreau, and Cadoudal,
that for the latter at the King's expense. When, finally, Christian
burial was refused to an actress, there were riots in Paris.</p>

<p>But the government continued its suicidal course; even the Vendée grew
disaffected, and, the suffrage having been greatly restricted, there
were murmurings about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> oligarchies and tyrants. At Nîmes the
Protestants feared another St. Bartholomew, and said so. Even moderate
royalists grew troubled, and could not retort when they heard the new
order stigmatized by the fitting name of "paternal anarchy." Both
veterans and conscripts deserted in great numbers from the army as
they saw their officers discharged by the score to make places for the
young aristocracy, or their comrades retired, nominally on half-pay,
in reality to eke out a subsistence as best they could. It was not
long before men showed each other pocket-pieces bearing Napoleon's
effigy, whispering as watchwords, "Courage and hope," or "He has been
and will be," or "Frenchmen, awake; the Emperor is waking." As early
as July, 1814, rumors of his return were rife in country districts,
and by autumn the longing for it was outspoken and general. In Paris
there was greater caution, but as Marmont was called "Judas" for
having betrayed his master, so Berthier was known as "Peter" in that
he had denied him, and it was a common joke to tie a white cockade to
the tail of a dog. Before the Chamber met the various factions openly
avowed themselves as either royalists, Bonapartists, liberals, or
Jacobins. The money estimates presented made it clear that a king was
more expensive than an emperor, and when the peers not only voted to
indemnify the emigrants for the lands held by their families, but
likewise passed a bill establishing the censorship of the press, it
was common talk that the present state of things could not last.</p>

<p>The number of French prisoners of war and of soldiers released from
the besieged fortresses in central Europe was about three hundred
thousand, of whom a third were veterans of the Empire. To these must
be added the army which Soult, ignorant of Napoleon's abdication, had
led to defeat at Toulouse, and the soldiers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> who had served in
Italy. These men, long accustomed to much consideration, found
themselves on their return to be persons of no consequence. They
learned that the great officers of the Empire were everywhere treated
with scant courtesy, and that the great ladies of the imperial court
were now virtually driven from the Tuileries by the significant
questions and loud asides of the royal personages who had supplanted
them. It was told in all public resorts how Ney had resented the rude
affronts put on his wife by the Duchess of Angoulême. The well-trained
subordinate officers of these contingents were turned adrift by
thousands on the same terms as those of Napoleon's own army, half-pay
if they showed themselves good Catholics, otherwise nothing. For the
most part, again, this promise was empty; young royalists were put in
their places, the pay of the old guard was reduced, a new noble guard
was organized, promotion was refused to those who had received
commissions during the operations of war, and the asylums established
for the orphans of those who had belonged to the Legion of Honor were
abolished. So bitter was the outcry that the King felt compelled to
dismiss his minister of war, and, not daring to substitute Marmont,
who demanded the place, appointed Soult. He too was speedily
discredited for harshness to Exelmans, a subordinate who was
discovered to have been in correspondence with Napoleon; and by the
middle of February, 1815, nearly all the soldiers were at heart
Bonapartists, their friends for the most part abetting them.</p>

</div>

<p>In less than two months after Louis XVIII took his seat, Talleyrand
and Fouché were deep in their element of plot and intrigue. They
thought of the son of Philippe Égalité as a possible constitutional
ruler; they talked of reëstablishing the imperial regency; with
Napoleon placed beyond the possibility of returning, the latter
course <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> would be safe. During the succeeding months they
continued to juggle with this double intrigue, and around their plots
clustered minor ones in mass. Lord Liverpool actually called
Wellington to London for fear the duke should be seized, and Marmont
put the Paris garrison under arms. On January twenty-first, 1815, the
death of Louis XVI was commemorated by the royalists with the wildest
talk; and such was the general fury over Exelmans's treatment that
Fouché at last stepped forward to give his conspiracy some form.
Carnot and Davout were both expected to coöperate; but although they
refused, enough officers of influence were secured to make a plan for
an extended insurrection entirely feasible. For this all parties were
willing to unite; no one knew or cared what was to supplant the
existing government&mdash;anything was better than "paternal anarchy."</p>

<p>How accurate the information was which reached Napoleon at Elba we
cannot ascertain, for his feelings were masked and his conduct was
non-committal. He had entirely recovered his health, and though old in
experience, he was only forty-five years of age, and still appeared
like one in the prime of life. He was apparently vigorous, being
short, thick-necked, and inclined to corpulence. His cheeks were
somewhat heavy and sensuous, his hair receded far back on the temples,
his limbs were powerful, his hands and feet were delicately formed and
noticeably small. His movements were nervous and well controlled, his
eye was clear and bright, his passions were strong, his self-control
was apparent, and the coördination of his powers was easy. To the
Elban peasant he was gracious; with his subordinates he was dignified;
among his many visitors he moved with good humor and tact; his
kindness to his mother and sister made both of them devoted and
happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> The only anxiety he displayed was in regard to assassination
and kidnapping: the former he said he could meet like a soldier; of
the latter he spoke with anxious foreboding. He had reason to fear
both. Every week either in France or Italy or both, there was a plot
among fanatical royalists and priests to kill him; and though the
Barbary pirates were eager to seize him and win a great ransom, they
were excelled in their zeal both by Mariotte, Talleyrand's agent in
Leghorn, and by Bruslart, a bitter and ancient enemy, who had been
appointed governor of Corsica for the purpose. For these reasons,
probably, the Emperor of Elba lived as far as possible in seclusion.
As time passed he grew less intimate with Campbell, but the Scotch
gentleman did not attribute the fact to discontent. Before leaving
Elba, on February sixteenth, to reside for a time in Florence and
perform the duties of English envoy in that place, he gave it as his
opinion that if Napoleon received the pension stipulated for in the
treaty he would remain tranquilly where he was.</p>

<p>It has lately been recalled that as early as July, 1814, the Emperor
of Elba remarked to an English visitor that Louis XVIII, being
surrounded by those who had betrayed the Empire, would in turn
probably be himself betrayed by them. For the ensuing four months,
however, the exile gave no sign of any deep purpose; to those who
wished to leave him, he gave a hearty good-by. In December, however,
he remarked to one of his old soldiers, pointedly, as the man thought:
"Well, grenadier, you are bored; ... take the weather as it comes."
Slipping a gold piece into the veteran's hand, he then turned away,
humming to a simple air the words, "This will not last forever."
Thereafter he dissuaded all who sought to depart, saying: "Be patient.
We'll pass these few winter days as best we may; then we'll try to
spend the spring in another fashion." This vague language may
possibly have referred to the Italian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> scheme, but on February
tenth he received a clear account of what had happened at Vienna, and
on the evening of the twelfth Fleury de Chaboulon, a confidential
friend of Maret, arrived in the disguise of a sailor, and revealed in
the fullest and most authentic way the state of France. When he heard
of the plan to reëstablish the regency, Napoleon burst out hotly: "A
regency! What for? Am I, then, dead?" Two days later, after long
conferences, the emissary was despatched to do what he could at
Naples, and the Emperor began his preparations.</p>

<p>This was soon known on the mainland, and three days later a personage
whose identity has never been revealed arrived in the guise of a
Marseilles merchant, declaring that, except the rich and the
emigrants, every human being in France longed for the Emperor's
return. If he would but set up his hat on the shores of Provence, it
would draw all men toward it. When Napoleon turned pseudo-historian he
declared in one place that the breaches of the Fontainebleau treaty
and his fears of deportation had nothing to do with his return from
Elba; in another he states the reverse. Since the legend he was then
studiously constructing required the unbroken devotion of the French
to the standard-bearer of the Revolution for the sake of consistency,
he probably recalled only the feelings awakened by Fleury's report
that opportunity was ripe, and that, too, earlier than had been
expected. But there were other motives at the time, for Peyrusse,
keeper of Napoleon's purse during the Elban sojourn, heard his master
asseverate that it would be more dangerous to remain in Porto Ferrajo
than to return to France. In any case, so far as France and the world
at large were concerned, the contemptuous indifference of Louis and
his ministers to their obligations under the treaty powerfully
justified <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span> Napoleon's course. Even Alexander and Castlereagh
had early made an indignant protest to Talleyrand; but the latter,
already deep in conspiracy, turned them off with a flippant rejoinder.</p>

<p>With great adroitness and secrecy Napoleon collected and fitted out
his little flotilla, which consisted of the <i>Inconstant</i>, a stout brig
assigned to him at Fontainebleau, and seven smaller craft. During the
preparations the French and English war-vessels patrolling the
neighboring waters came and went, but their captains suspected
nothing. Campbell's departure created a false rumor among the
islanders that England was favoring some expedition on which the
Emperor was about to embark, thus allaying all suspicion. When, on the
twenty-sixth, a little army of eleven hundred men found itself afloat,
with eighty horses and a number of cannon, no one seemed to realize
what had happened; except Drouot, who pleaded against Napoleon's
rashness, all were enthusiastic. To avoid suspicion, each captain
steered his own course, and the various craft dotting the sea at
irregular intervals looked no way unlike the other boats which plied
those waters. Several men-of-war were sighted, but they kept their
course. As one danger after another was averted, the great
adventurer's spirits rose until he was exuberant with joy, and talked
of Austerlitz. It was March first when land was finally sighted from
the <i>Inconstant</i>; as if by magic, the other vessels hove in sight
immediately, and by four the men were all ashore on the strand of the
Gulf of Jouan. Cambronne, a colonel of the imperial guards, was sent
to requisition horses at Cannes, with the strict injunction that not a
drop of blood be shed. As the great actor had theatrically said on
board his brig, he was "about to produce a great novelty," and he
counted upon dazzling the beholders into an enthusiasm they had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> ceased to feel for the old plays. Among others brought to
Napoleon's bivouac that night was the Prince of Monaco, who had been
found by Cambronne at St. Pierre traveling in a four-horse carriage,
and had been taken as a prisoner into Napoleon's presence. "Where are
you going?" was, according to tradition, the greeting of Napoleon. "I
am returning to my domains," came the reply. "Indeed! and I too," was
the merry retort.</p>

<p>Recalling the mortal agony he had endured on the highway through Aix
but a short year before, and its causes, and having been informed how
bitter was the anti-royalist feeling in the Dauphiné, Napoleon set his
little army in march direct toward Grenoble. At Cannes there was
general indifference; at Grasse it was found that the division general
in command had fled, and there were a few timid shouts of "Long live
the Emperor!" Thence to Digne on the Grenoble highway was a mountain
track over a ridge twelve thousand feet above the sea. In twenty hours
the slender column marched thirty-five miles. The "growlers" joked
about the "little corporal" who trudged at their side, the Alpine
hamlets provided abundant rations, and the government officials
furnished blank passports which enabled Napoleon to send emissaries
both to Grenoble and to Marseilles, where Masséna was in command. The
little garrison of Digne was Bonapartist in feeling, but it was not
yet ready to join Napoleon, and withdrew; that at Sisteron was kept
from meddling by a body of troops which had been despatched as a corps
of observation from Marseilles, while the populace shouted heartily
for the Emperor. At Gap the officials strove to organize resistance,
but they desisted before the menaces of the people. By this time the
peasantry were coming in by hundreds. So far Napoleon's enterprise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> had received but four recruits: two soldiers from Antibes, a
tanner from Grasse, and a gendarme. Now he was so confident that he
dismissed the peasantry, assuring them that the soldiers in front
would join his standards.</p>

<p>On March seventh the head of the column of imperial adventurers
reached La Mure, a short day's march from Grenoble. They were received
with enthusiasm, and a bucket of the poor native wine was brought for
the refreshment of the men. When all had been served Napoleon reached
out for the cheap little glass, and swallowed his ration like the
rest. There was wild delight among both his men and the onlookers as
the "army" set out for Laffray, the next hamlet, where was a small
detachment sent from Grenoble to destroy a bridge over the Drac. With
inscrutable faces they stood across the highway, lances set and
muskets charged, under orders to fire on Napoleon the moment he should
appear. At length the critical moment arrived. "There he is! Fire!"
cried a royalist officer. The soldiers clutched their arms, their
faces blanched, their knees shook, and they&mdash;disobeyed! Napoleon,
walking slowly, advanced within pistol-shot. He wore the old familiar
gray surtout, the well-known cocked hat, and a tricolor cockade.
"Soldiers of the Fifth," he said in a strong, calm voice, "behold me!"
Then advancing a few paces farther, he threw open his coat and
displaying the familiar uniform, he called: "If there be one soldier
among you who wishes to kill his Emperor, he can. I come to offer
myself to your assaults." In an instant the opposing ranks melted into
a mob of sobbing, cheering men, kissing Napoleon's shoes, struggling
to touch the skirts of his shabby garments. The surrounding throng
crowded near in sympathy. "Soldiers," cried the magician, "I come
with a handful of brave men because I count on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> you and the
people. The throne of the Bourbons is illegitimate because it was not
erected by the nation. Your fathers are threatened by a restoration of
titles, of privilege, and of feudal rights; is it not so?" "Yes, yes,"
shouted the multitude. At that instant appeared a rider arrayed in the
uniform of the national guard, but wearing a huge tricolor cockade.
Alighting at Napoleon's feet, he said: "Sire, I am Jean Dumoulin the
glove-maker; I bring to your majesty a hundred thousand francs and my
arm." At that instant likewise an imperial proclamation denouncing
traitors, and promising that under the old standards victory would
return like the storm-wind, was passing from hand to hand in the
garrison of Grenoble. Labédoyère, the colonel, of the Seventh of the
line, first announced his purpose to support his Emperor, and the
royalist officers saw the imperialist feeling spread with dismay. They
arranged to evacuate the place next morning. At seven in the evening
Napoleon summoned the town; the commandant, unable to resist the
pressure of both soldiers and populace, fled with a few adherents, and
at ten the gates were opened. The reception of the returning exile was
hearty and impressive. It was with an army of seven thousand men that,
after a rest of thirty-six hours, he started for Lyons.</p>

<p>"As far as Grenoble I was an adventurer; at Grenoble I was a prince,"
wrote Napoleon at St. Helena. If this were true, at Lyons he was an
Emperor in fact as well as in name, that great city receiving him with
plaudits as energetic as were the execrations with which they
dismissed Artois and Macdonald. Recalling the lessons of his youth,
some learned in Corsica, some in the Rhone valley, the returning
Emperor carefully felt the pulse of public opinion as he journeyed. He
found the longing for peace to be universal, and even before entering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> Lyons he began to promise peace with honor. But this he
quickly found was not enough: it must be peace with liberty as well.
The sole task before him, therefore, he declared to be that of
protecting the interests and principles of the Revolution against the
returning emigrants. France, restored to her glory, was to live in
harmony with other European powers as long as they minded their own
affairs. Napoleon, the liberator of France! To terrify foreign
invaders and intestine foes a great united nation was to speak in
trumpet notes. From Lyons, therefore, second city of the Empire, was
summoned a popular assembly to revise the constitution. To convey the
impression that Austria was in secret accord with the Emperor's
course, three delegates from the eastern capital were summoned to
assist at a significant ceremony which was to occur almost
immediately, the coronation of the Empress and the King of Rome. Still
further, a decree was issued which banished the returned emigrants and
swept away the pretensions of the arrogant nobles. Talleyrand,
Marmont, Augereau, and Dalberg were attainted, and the noble guard of
the King was abolished. Under these influences Bonapartist feeling
grew so intense and spread so widely that the army of Soult, which had
been assembled in the southeast to oppose Murat, turned imperialist
almost to a man. Masséna, who seems to have followed the lead of
Fouché, waited to see what was coming, and remained neutral. Ney fell
in with the general movement, and joined Napoleon at Auxerre. "Embrace
me, my dear general," were the Emperor's words of greeting. "I am glad
to see you; and I want neither explanations nor justifications."</p>

<p>All resistance disappeared before Napoleon's advance as he passed
Autun and descended the Yonne valley toward Paris. Everywhere there
were dissensions among <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> the populace, but the enthusiasm of
the soldiers and their sympathizers triumphed. The troops despatched
by the King's government to overpower the "usurper" sooner or later
went over to the "usurper's" standards. One morning a placard was
found on the railing around the Vendôme column: "Napoleon to Louis
XVIII. My good brother, it is useless to send me any more troops; I
have enough." Paris was in a storm of suppressed excitement. The
measures of resistance were half-hearted; the King made lavish
concessions and the chambers passed excellent laws without attracting
any attention or sympathy; volunteers were raised, but there was no
energy in their organization. When Napoleon reached Fontainebleau on
the eighteenth, the reserves stationed in and near Paris on the south
came over to him in a body. On the nineteenth Louis issued a
despairing address to the army, and fled to Lille; on the morning of
the twentieth the capital found itself without any vestige of
government. The streets were thronged with people, but there was no
disorder until a band of royalists attacked a half-pay officer wearing
the imperial cockade. At once the city guard formed and intervened to
quell the disturbance. Thereupon the imperialists endeavored to seize
the Tuileries; they, too, were checked, and a double force, royalist
and imperial, was set to defend that important spot. Over other public
buildings the imperial colors waved alone and undisturbed. During the
afternoon the crowds dispersed and the imperial officials quietly
resumed their places. At nine in the evening a post-chaise rolled up
to the Tuileries gate, Napoleon alighted, and the observers thought
his smile was like that of one walking in a dream. At once he was
caught in the brawny arms of his admirers, and handed upward from step
to step, from landing to landing. So fierce was the affection of his
friends that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> his life seemed to be in danger from their
embraces, and it was with relief that he entered his cabinet and
closed the door, to find himself among a few of his old stanch and
tried servants, with Caulaincourt at their head. This reception had
been in sharp contrast to the apathy displayed on the streets, where
the people were few in number, unenthusiastic, and indifferent. "They
let me come," said Napoleon to Mollien, "as they let the other go."
Finding himself unable to endure the loneliness of the Tuileries, and
depressed by the associations of the familiar scenes, he withdrew in a
few days to the comparative seclusion of the Élysée, then a suburban
mansion dubbed by courtesy a palace.</p>

<p>Some portion of Napoleon's leisure in Elba had been devoted, as was
mentioned in another connection, to sketching the outline of a
treatise intended to prove that his dynasty was quite as legitimate as
any other which had ruled over France. His illusions of European
empire were dismissed either permanently or temporarily, and for the
moment he was the apostle of nationality and popular sovereignty in
France. Before laying his head on his pillow in the Tuileries he
displayed this fact to the world in the constitution of his cabinet,
which would in our day be designated as a cabinet of concentration,
representative of various shades of opinion. Maret, Davout,
Cambacérès, Gaudin, Mollien, Decrès, Caulaincourt, Fouché, and Carnot
accepted the various portfolios; most surprising of all, Benjamin
Constant, the constitutional republican, became president of a
reconstructed council of state. In connection with the announcement of
these names, the nation was informed that the constitution was to be
revised, and that the censorship of the press was abolished. In
reference to the latter, Napoleon remarked that, since everything
possible had been said about him during the past year, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> he
could himself be no worse off than he was, but the editors could still
find much to say about his enemies. To Constant he frankly explained
what he meant by revision. The common people had welcomed his return
because he was one of themselves, and at a signal he could have the
nobles murdered. But he wanted no peasants' war, and, as the taste had
returned for unrestricted discussion, public trials, emancipated
elections, responsible ministers, and all the paraphernalia of
constitutional government, the public must be gratified. For all this
he was ready, and with it for peace. But peace he could win only by
victory, for, although in his conduct, in the Lyons decrees, and in
casual talk, he hinted at negotiations with foreign powers, those
negotiations were purely imaginary.</p>

<p>With a clear comprehension of the situation, the ministers went to
work. On April twenty-third was promulgated the Additional Act,
whereby the franchise was extended, the state church abolished,
liberty of worship guaranteed, and every wretched remnant of privilege
or divine right expunged. The two chambers were retained, many
imperial dignitaries being assigned to the House of Peers, the
Bonaparte brothers, Lucien, Joseph, and Jerome, among the number. It
was, as Chateaubriand sarcastically said, a revised and improved
edition of Louis's constitution. The preamble, however, was new; it
set forth that Napoleon, having been long engaged in constructing a
great European federal system suited to the spirit of the time and
favorable to the spirit of civilization, had now abandoned it, and
would henceforth devote himself to a single aim, the perfect security
of public liberty. This specious representation, half true and half
false, awakened no enthusiasm in France; it was accepted, along with
the Additional Act, by a plebiscite, but by only a million three
hundred thousand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> votes&mdash;less than half the number cast for
the Consulate and the Empire. This was largely due to a curious
apathy, induced by a still more curious but firm conviction that at
last France had secured peace with honor. Reference has been made to a
military conspiracy fomented by Fouché in the North; before the
hostile public feeling thus engendered in that quarter Louis fled to
Ghent within five days after Napoleon reached Paris, and, though the
royal princes were able to carry on civil war in the South a little
longer, it was generally felt that the nation now had a ruler of its
own choosing, and that if they attended strictly to their own affairs
they would be left in peace. For considerable time there was little
news from abroad, and so swift was the rush of internal affairs that
no heed was given to what there was.</p>

<p>This was suddenly changed in April, when it was brought home to the
nation that the specter of war had again been raised, and that the
dynasties were finally a unit in their determination to extirpate the
Napoleonic régime as a measure of self-defense. Every man with any
means saw himself beggared, and every mother felt her son slipping
from her arms to swim once more that sea of blood in which for a
generation the hope of the nation had been submerged. The depression
was general and terrible, for the prospect was appalling. England,
entangled with dynastic alliances in order to preserve her prosperity
and dignity, had lost most of her serious and trusted leaders, and the
few who survived were so panic-stricken as to have little
perspicacity. The King's illness having at last removed him from
public life, he had been succeeded by the most profligate and
frivolous of all the line of English kings, the Prince Regent, who was
later George IV. Percival and Liverpool were not merely conservative
from principle; they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> were negative from the love of
negatives. Already they had laid the basis, in their mismanagement of
domestic affairs, for the social turbulence which within a short time
was to compel the most sweeping reforms. Castlereagh had not even an
inkling of what the treaty of Chaumont might mean to Great Britain in
the end. To destroy Napoleon he was perfectly content that his own
free country should support a system of dynastic politics destructive
of every principle of liberty.</p>

<p>The Congress of Vienna represented, not a confederation of states, but
a league of dynasties posing as nations and banded for mutual
self-preservation. To them the permanent restoration of Napoleon could
mean only one thing, the recognition of a nation's right to choose its
own rulers, and that would be the end of absolutism in Europe. To
Great Britain it would mean the destruction of her prosperity, or at
least a serious diminution of both power and prestige. The late
coalition, therefore, was re-cemented without difficulty, but on a
basis entirely new. The account of Napoleon's escape reached Vienna on
March sixth. Within the week Maria Louisa, now entirely under
Neipperg's influence, wrote declaring herself a stranger to all
Napoleon's schemes, and a few days later the French attendants of the
little King of Rome were dismissed; the child's last words to Méneval
were a message of affection to his father.<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17"><span class="smaller">[17]</span></a> At that time
negotiations among the powers were progressing famously, each having
secured its main object; on March thirteenth the Congress, under
Castlereagh's instigation, publicly denounced Napoleon as the "enemy
and disturber of the world's peace," and proclaimed him an outlaw. The
Whigs stigmatized the paper in parliament as provocative of
assassination and a disgrace to the English character, but, of all
the important journals, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> the "Morning Chronicle" alone was
courageous enough to sustain them, asserting that it was a matter of
complete indifference to England whether a Bourbon or a Bonaparte
reigned in France. These manly protests were unheeded, and by the
twenty-fifth all Europe, except Naples, was united against France
alone.</p>

     Misfortune.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1815</p>

<p>The supreme effort of the dynasties to outlaw Napoleon, and restore
France to the Bourbons, was made by what was nominally an alliance of
eight members&mdash;Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, France, Spain,
Portugal, and Sweden. The last was, however, absorbed in her struggle
with Norway, and, though Spain and Portugal were signatories, the real
strength of the coalition arranged at Vienna lay in a virtual renewal
of the treaty of Chaumont: Austria, Prussia, and Russia were each to
put a hundred and eighty thousand men in the field, and Great Britain
was to continue her subsidies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> On April fourth, the sovereigns of Europe were notified that
the Empire meant peace; they retorted by the mobilization of their
forces, and by denouncing in a joint protocol the treaty of Paris. In
his extremity Napoleon appealed to Talleyrand, but that minister knew
too well the temper of the Congress at Vienna, and refused to
coöperate. The versatile Fouché thereupon initiated a new plot, this
time against Napoleon, and sounded Metternich; but Metternich was
dumb. The other diplomats asseverated that they did not wish to
interfere with the domestic affairs of France; but they prevaricated,
intending nothing less than the complete restoration of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of this storm-cloud Napoleon regulated his domestic
affairs of state with intrepid calmness. He had no easy task. It was
the revived hatred of the masses for priests and nobles to which he
had appealed on his progress from Grenoble, and, observing the wild
outbursts of the populace at Lyons, he had whispered, "This is
madness." It was with studied deliberation, therefore, that in Paris
he cast himself completely upon the moderate liberals. This alienated
the Jacobin elements throughout the country, and they, in turn,
stirred up the royalists. When it became clear that neither Maria
Louisa nor the King of Rome was to be crowned, and that there was no
help in Austria, even the imperialists displayed a dangerous temper.
Such was the general uneasiness about war that the first measures of
army reorganization were taken almost stealthily. It was easy enough
to establish the skeleton of formation, and not very difficult to find
trustworthy officers, commissioned and non-commissioned; but to summon
recruits was to announce the coming war. Of the three hundred thousand
veterans now returned home, less than one fifth responded to the call
for volunteers; the Emperor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> had reckoned on four fifths at
least. The National Guard was so surly that many felt it would be
bravado for Napoleon to review them. But he was determined to do so,
and on April sixteenth the hazardous ceremony took place. Until at
least half the companies had been reviewed not a cheer was heard; then
there were a few scattering shouts here and there in the ranks;
finally there was some genuine enthusiasm.</p>

<p>By the middle of May the national deputies summoned at Lyons began to
arrive. They were to meet, after the fashion of Charles the Great's
assemblies, in the open field. Their task was to be the making of a
new constitution. It was not reassuring news that they brought from
their various homes, and their accounts disturbed public opinion in
Paris sadly. Before long it was known that civil war had again broken
out in Vendée; the consequences would have been most disastrous had
not La Rochejacquelein, the insurgent leader, been killed on June
fourth. As it was, the ignoble slaughter of one of their order
intensified the bitterness of the nobles. Worse still, it had been
found that of the six hundred and twenty-nine deputies five hundred
were ardent constitutionalists indifferent to Napoleon, and that only
fifty were his devoted personal friends; there were even between
thirty and forty who were Jacobins, and at Fouché's command. Under
these circumstances the Emperor dared not hold the promised national
congress. What could be substituted for it? The great dramatic artist
was not long at a loss. He determined to summon the electoral deputies
to a gorgeous open-air ceremony on June first, and have them stamp
with their approval the Additional Act. A truly impressive spectacle
would pass muster for the promised "field of May," and profoundly
affect the minds of all present. But, unfortunately, though Ségur
made the plan, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> though every detail was carefully studied
by Napoleon, the affair was not impressive. About eighteen thousand
persons assembled on the benches, and there was a vast crowd in the
field. The cannon roared their welcome, and the people cheered the
imperial carriage, the marshals, the body-guard, and the procession.
But when Napoleon and his brothers stepped forth, clad like actors in
theatrical costumes of white velvet, wearing Spanish cloaks
embroidered with the imperial device of golden bees, and with great
plumed hats on their heads, there was a hush of disappointment. The
populace had expected a soldier in a soldier's uniform; many had felt
sure "he" would wear that of the National Guard.</p>

<p>There was, however, no sign of disrespect while the ministers and the
reconstituted corps of marshals filed to their places. Among the
latter were familiar faces&mdash;Ney, Moncey, Kellermann, Sérurier,
Lefebvre, Grouchy, Oudinot, Jourdan, Soult, and Masséna. A committee
of the deputies then stood forth, and their chairman read an address
declaring that France desired a ruler of her own selection, and
promising loyalty in the coming war. Napoleon arose, and in spite of
his absurd clothes commanded attention while he set forth his reasons
for offering a ready-made constitution instead of risking interminable
debate. Although he declared that what was offered could, of course,
be amended, there was no applause, except from a few soldiers. When
the chambers met, a week later, Lanjuinais, one of Napoleon's lifelong
opponents, was chosen president of the House of Deputies. The speech
from the throne was clever and conciliatory, and in spite of evident
distrust both houses promised all the strength of France for
defense&mdash;but for defense only. The peers declared that under her new
institutions France could never be swept away by the temptations of
victory; the deputies asserted that nothing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> could carry the
nation beyond the bounds of its own defense, not even the will of a
victorious prince.</p>

<p>The anxieties and exertions of two months were manifest in Napoleon's
appearance. His features, though impressive, were drawn, and his long
jaw grew prominent. He lost flesh everywhere except around the waist,
so that his belly, hitherto inconspicuous, looked almost pendulous.
When standing, he folded his hands sometimes in front, sometimes
behind, but separated them frequently to take snuff or rub his nose.
Sometimes he heaved a mechanical sigh, swallowing as if to calm inward
agitation. Often he scowled, and looked out through half-closed lids
as if growing far-sighted; the twitching of his eye and ear on the
left side grew more frequent. With thickening difficulties and
increasing annoyance, serious urinary and stomach troubles set in;
there was also a persistent hacking cough. Recourse was again had to
protracted warm baths in order to alleviate the accompanying
nervousness; but as the ailments were refractory, a mystery soon
attached to the malady, and his enemies said it was a loathsome
disease. In spite of the statements both of the Prussian commissioner
at Fontainebleau, Count Truchsess-Waldburg, and of Sir Hudson Lowe, it
is highly improbable that Napoleon's health was undermined by sexual
infection. He was surrounded all his life by malignant attendants, and
among the sweepings of their minds, which in recent years have been
scattered before the public, there would be some proof of the fact. In
the utter absence of any reliable information, some have guessed that
the trouble was the preliminary stage in the disease of which he died;
and others, again, in view of his quick changes of mood, his
depressions, exaltations, sharpened sensibilities, and abrupt
rudeness, have explained all his peculiarities in disease and health
by attributing them to a recondite <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> form of epilepsy.
Exhausted and nervous, the sufferer might well, as was the case, be
found in tears before the portrait of his son; he might well lift up
his voice, as he was heard to do, against the destiny which had played
him false. But he was quite shrewd enough to see that during his
absence no regency could be trusted, and he arranged to conduct
affairs by special messengers. Joseph was to preside and give the
casting-vote in the council of state; to Lucien was given a seat in
the same body; but the supreme power rested in Napoleon.</p>

<p>When Wellington replaced Castlereagh at the Congress of Vienna, it was
quickly apparent that he was greater in the field than at the
council-board. Both he and Blücher desired to assume the offensive
quickly; but inasmuch as Alexander was determined to retain his
ascendancy in the coalition, and as each power insisted on its due
share in the struggle, it was arranged to begin hostilities on June
twenty-seventh, the earliest date at which the Russian troops could
reach the confines of France. There were to be three armies.
Schwarzenberg, with two hundred and fifty thousand men, comprising the
Austrian, Russian, and Bavarian contingents, was to attack across the
upper Rhine; Blücher, with one hundred and fifty thousand Prussians,
was to advance across the lower Rhine; and Wellington in the
Netherlands was to collect an army of one hundred and fifty thousand,
compounded of Dutch, Belgians, Hanoverians, and some thirty-eight
thousand British, who could be there assembled. The two latter armies
were in existence by the first of June, but Wellington was
dissatisfied with the quality of his motley force; even the English
contingent was not the best possible, for his Peninsular veterans had
been sent to find their match in Jackson's riflemen at the battle of
New Orleans.</p>

<p>On the eve of hostilities Napoleon had one hundred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> and
twenty-four thousand effective men, and three thousand five hundred
more in his camp train; Wellington had one hundred and six thousand,
but of these four thousand Hanoverians were left in garrison; Blücher
had about one hundred and seventeen thousand. Neither of the two
allied generals dreamed that Napoleon would choose the daring form of
attack upon which he decided&mdash;that of a wedge driven into the broken
line nearly a hundred miles in length upon which his enemy lay&mdash;for to
do so he must pass the Ardennes. But he did choose it, and selected
for the purpose the valleys of the Sambre and the Meuse. Allowing for
the differences in topography, the idea was identical with that which,
nineteen years before, he had executed splendidly in Piedmont and
repeated in Germany. The twin enemy seemed unaware that its long and
straggling line must, in case of activity, either be broken to
maintain the respective bases or else abandon one base for
concentration and be cut off from supplies. Wellington's base was
westward at Antwerp, Blücher's eastward through Liège toward the
Rhine. Vacillation would ensue, Napoleon felt, on a central attack,
and in that vacillation he intended to repeat with Blücher what he had
done with Brunswick at Jena.</p>

<p>The opening of the campaign was sufficiently auspicious. By a superb
march during the night of June thirteenth, Napoleon's army had gained
a most advantageous position. The first corps under d'Erlon was at
Solre on the Sambre, the second under Reille was at Leers. The guard,
the sixth corps under Lobau, the line cavalry and the third corps
under Vandamme, stood in that order on a line northeasterly from
Beaumont, and due east of that place were four cavalry corps; the
fourth corps under the young and dashing Gérard had marched from Metz
and were at Philippeville; to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> south lay the guard cavalry
and the reserve artillery under Grouchy. In front was Charleroi,
whence a broad turnpike led almost direct to Brussels, thirty-four
miles due north; another turned eastward toward Liège. Thirteen miles
distant on this was Sombreffe; somewhat farther on that, Quatre Bras,
both on the highway running east and west between Namur and Nivelles.
To have accomplished such marches as it did, the French army must have
been fine; to have secured such a brilliant strategic position its
general must have been almost inspired. He commanded the operating
lines of both Wellington and Blücher, while they were far distant from
each other, separated by serious obstacles, both alike instinct with
centrifugal rather than centripetal tendency. The same high qualities
which shone in their general distinguished the subordinate French
commanders. Though many of the famous names are absent from the
list,&mdash;Mortier, for instance, having fallen ill on the frontier,&mdash;yet
Soult was present as chief of staff, and Ney was coming up to take
command of the left wing. Reille, d'Erlon, and Foy were veterans of
the Peninsular war; what twenty-two years of service had done for the
"wild Hun," Vandamme, is known. Kellermann was made famous by Marengo,
Lobau was noted for daring, Gérard had earned distinction in Russia,
and though Grouchy's merit has been the theme of much discussion, yet
he had been famous under Jourdan and Moreau, and nothing had occurred
in the long interval to tarnish his reputation.</p>

<p>Nearly half of Blücher's troops were irregular reserves, and many of
the regulars were recruits, but all were thoroughly drilled and well
equipped. The passion of hatred which animated them was comparable
only to the "French fury" with which Napoleon's army would fight for
national existence. Such was the reverence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> for routine among
the Prussian officers, and so bitter were the jealousies of the petty
aristocracy from which they sprang, that the King dared not promote on
any basis except that of seniority. In order to make Gneisenau second
in command, York, Kleist, and Tauenzien were stationed elsewhere, and
Bülow was put in command of a reserve to hold Belgium when Blücher
should advance to Paris. The aged but fiery marshal had not mended his
health by the self-indulgence of a year; the three division generals,
Ziethen, Pirch, and Thielemann were capable men of local renown.
Gneisenau and Bülow were the only first-rate men among the Prussian
commanders, but for rousing enthusiasm Blücher's name was a word to
conjure with. Wellington was felt by his officers and soldiers to be a
man of real power; his British recruits were well drilled, and his
veterans were good. His associate generals were no more famous than
those of Gneisenau, but they were, for the most part, English
gentlemen with a high sense of duty and much executive ability. One of
his corps was commanded by the Prince of Orange, a respectable
soldier, whose name, however, was more valuable than the experience he
had gained in the Peninsula as aide-de-camp; the other corps was under
Lord Hill, an admirable subordinate and an excellent commander. The
only English general whose name is a familiar one abroad was Picton,
who died on the field. As to the quality of the respective armies, it
has become the fashion of each nation to decry that of its own and
overrate that of the other two. Thus they condone their own blunders,
and yet heighten the renown of victory. Napoleon was superior in
organization, in cavalry, and in artillery to either Wellington or
Blücher, but he was inferior to both in infantry. He was in wretched
health, and he had a desperate cause. Taking fully into account his
consummate ability and personal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> prestige, it yet remains true
that the odds against him were high, certainly eight to five.</p>

<p>Ziethen's posts before Charleroi saw the French camp-fires in the
early hours of June fourteenth; that evening they began to withdraw
toward Fleurus, whither the remainder of the Prussian army was
gradually set in motion. It seems incredible that this should have
been the first move of the allies toward concentrating their widely
scattered forces, for neither Wellington nor Blücher was completely
surprised. Both commanders had for two days been aware, in a general
way, of Napoleon's movements, but they were awaiting developments. It
was Wellington's opinion, carefully set forth in his old age, that it
would have been better strategy for the French to advance so as to
turn his right, seize his munitions, and cut off his base; but as this
would have rolled up the entire allied force, ready to deliver battle
with odds of two to one, the statement may perhaps be accepted as an
explanation, but certainly not as a justification.</p>

<p>In the dawn of the fifteenth a ringing, rousing proclamation, like
those of the olden time, and written the day before on the anniversary
of Marengo, was read to the French soldiers. It was in high spirits
that the army, in three columns, began to march. The left, under
Reille, dislodged the Prussian outposts from Thuin, and, forcing them
back through Marchiennes, seized the bridge at that place, and crossed
to the left bank of the Sambre. The movement was complete by ten in
the morning. The center under Napoleon comprised the mass of the army:
Pajol, Vandamme, Lobau, the Guard, Exelmans, Kellermann, and Milhaud.
Soult despatched his orders by a solitary aide, who broke his leg by a
fall from his horse, and failed to deliver them. Though at equally
critical moments before both Eylau and Wagram, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> Berthier had
done as Soult did, with identical results, yet the latter was justly
and severely blamed. Had Vandamme been found, the movements of the
center would have been greatly accelerated, the speedy capture of
Charleroi would have enabled the third corps to reach Fleurus in time
to intercept Ziethen, and thus the whole course of events would have
been changed. The marshal's ill success was, therefore, as Napoleon
called it, a "deplorable mischance," and it was high noon before
Pajol, with the van, reached Charleroi and, after a smart engagement,
drove out the Prussians. The right wing, under Gérard, was in motion
at five in the morning, but it also was detained by a serious
disaster. Shortly after starting it was found that Bourmont, the
commander of its best division, a man who had been Chouan,
imperialist, and royalist by turns, had deserted with his chief of
staff and eight soldiers. Having been at the council of war, he had
the latest information of Napoleon's secret plans, and his treason
demoralized the troops he so basely abandoned. It was long before
confidence could be restored; the crossing at Charleroi had been
delayed too long, and it was nightfall when Gérard at last reached
Châtelet, four miles below, secured the bridge, and crossed with only
half his men. The campaign opened, if not in disaster, at least with
only partial success.</p>

     Instructions to Grouchy &mdash; His Advance from Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>For four hours after his arrival at Charleroi, Napoleon, uneasy as to
the whereabouts of his detachments, stood in idleness waiting for
news. During this interval the first Prussian corps under Ziethen,
retreating from Charleroi, reached Fleurus unmolested, all except a
small body, which gathered at Gosselies, on the Brussels road, but was
easily dispersed by Reille. It seemed as if the road to Quatre Bras
was open, and when, at half-past four, Ney appeared, he was put in
command of the left, with verbal instructions, as Napoleon asserted
some years later, to seize that strategic point. Within these limits
he was to act independently. If Quatre Bras were surprised and held,
the second move could be attempted: the seizure of Sombreffe. Since
the highway between the two was the only line by which the allied
armies could quickly unite, the possibility <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> of attacking them
separately would be assured even if the successive attacks should
follow each other so closely as to be substantially one battle. Either
Ney misunderstood, or Napoleon recorded what he intended to say, not
what he actually said. Colonel Heymès, Ney's chief of staff, declared
that the Emperor's final words were, "Go, and drive back the enemy";
the Emperor asserted that his orders to go and hold Quatre Bras were
positive.</p>

<p>It is also a matter of dispute whether or not Napoleon had hoped,
after seizing the bridges and crossing the Sambre, to complete his
movement by surprising both Quatre Bras and Sombreffe on that same
day, the fifteenth. Had he done so, Blücher might possibly have
withdrawn to effect a junction with Wellington for the decisive
conflict, and thus have thwarted Napoleon's strategy; but it is not
likely, for that move, as finally executed, was the work not of
Blücher but of Gneisenau; at this stage of the campaign the Prussians
would probably have retreated toward Namur. Whatever may have been
Napoleon's intention, Ney hurried to Gosselies, stationed Reille to
hold the place, and then, despatching one division to pursue the
Prussians, and another, with Piré's cavalry, toward Quatre Bras, put
himself at the head of the cavalry of the guard to help in seizing
this latter important point. But at seven his force, to their
astonishment, was confronted by a strong body of Nassauers from
Wellington's army, who, having passed Quatre Bras, had seized Frasnes,
a village two and a half miles in advance. These made no stand, but
Ney, instead of proceeding immediately to attack Quatre Bras itself,
left his men to hold the position at Frasnes, and hurried away to
consult his superior. For this he had excellent reasons: his staff was
not yet organized, and d'Erlon's corps was not within call; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span>
he was therefore too weak for the movement contemplated by his orders.
At the same moment Napoleon, who had been in the saddle since three in
the morning, and who had become convinced that the retreating
Prussians would not halt at Fleurus, but would rejoin their main army,
turned back to Charleroi, and, on reaching his quarters an hour later,
flung himself in utter exhaustion upon his couch. In fact, he was in
exquisite torture from the complication of urinary, hemorrhoidal, and
other troubles which his long day's ride had aggravated, and, as he
declared at St. Helena,&mdash;probably the truth,&mdash;he had lost his
assurance of final success. The day had been fairly successful, but at
what a cost of energy! No one, he least of all, could feel that there
had been any buoyancy in the movements or favoring fate in the
combinations of his armies.</p>

<p>Throughout the day Blücher had displayed a fiery zeal. Since early in
May he had had no serious consultation with Wellington, and in a
general conversation held at that time there had been merely a vague
understanding as to a union at some point south of Sombreffe. That
town was accordingly selected by him for concentration, and in general
his orders had been well executed. Why the bridges of Marchiennes and
Châtelet were not undermined and blown up by the Prussians has never
been explained. Moreover, the language of Gneisenau's orders to Bülow
being vague, the latter misinterpreted it, and his much-needed force
was not brought in, as expected. Wellington's conduct is a riddle. He
displayed little anxiety and found time for social enjoyment as well
as for the activities of military command in a supreme crisis. About
the middle of the afternoon he was informed, through the Prince of
Orange, as to his enemy's movements. With perfect calm, he commanded
that his troops should be ready in their cantonments; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> at
five he issued orders for the divisions to march with a view to
concentration at Nivelles, the easternmost point which he intended to
occupy; at ten, just as he was setting out for the noted ball which
the Duchess of Richmond was giving on the eve of decision, he gave
definite instructions for the concentration to begin. These were his
very first steps toward concentration, although twenty-seven years
later he made the assertion, supported only by his despatch to
Bathurst of the nineteenth, that he had ordered the Anglo-allied army
to concentrate to the left, as Blücher had ordered the Prussians to
concentrate to the right. As a matter of fact, he was twenty-four
hours behind Blücher in ordering his first defensive movements. This
is not excused by the fact that his movement of concentration was
completed somewhat earlier than Blücher's. About twenty minutes after
the Prince of Orange had reached the ball-room, Wellington sent him
away quietly, and then, summoning the Duke of Richmond, who, it is
doubtfully said, was to have command of the reserve when completely
formed, he asked for a map. The two withdrew to an adjoining room.
Wellington closed the door, and said, with an oath, "Napoleon has
humbugged me." He then explained that he had ordered his army to
concentrate at Quatre Bras, adding, "But we shall not stop him there;
and if so, I must fight him here," marking Waterloo with his
thumb-nail on the map as he spoke. It was not until the next morning
that he left for the front. Though Napoleon, on the evening of the
fifteenth, had neither Quatre Bras nor Sombreffe, he held all the
debatable ground; and if, next morning, he could seize the two towns
simultaneously, the first move in his great game would be won. It
seems as if he must risk everything to that end.</p>

<p>What passed between Napoleon and Ney from midnight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> until two
in the morning is unknown. There is no evidence that the Emperor
expressed serious dissatisfaction, although he may have been
exasperated. He was not exactly in a position to give vent to his
feelings. Whatever was the nature of their conversation, Ney was again
at his post long before dawn, and not a soldier moved from Charleroi
until nearly noon! It seems that Napoleon, or Ney, or both, must have
been stubbornly convinced that Wellington could not concentrate within
twenty-four hours. That Napoleon was not incapacitated by prostration
is proved by his acts: about five he sent a preliminary order to Ney;
very early, also, he took measures to complete Gérard's crossing at
Châtelet; and then, having considered at length the alternatives of
pushing straight on to Brussels or of taking the course he did, he had
reached a decision as early as seven o'clock. It seems almost certain
that he delayed chiefly to get his troops well in hand, partly to give
them a much-needed rest. They had been seventeen hours afoot the
previous day. Toward nine, believing that more of Ney's command was
assembled than was yet the case, he sent a fretful order commanding
the marshal to seize Quatre Bras, and stating that a semi-independent
command, under Grouchy, would stand at Sombreffe, while he himself
would hold Gembloux. This done, he settled into apparent lethargy. To
Grouchy he wrote that he intended to attack the enemy at Sombreffe,
and "even at Gembloux," and then to operate immediately with Ney
"against the English." His scheme was able, for if at either salient
angle, Quatre Bras or Sombreffe, his presence should be necessary, he
could, at need, quickly join either Ney or Grouchy; but his senses
must have been dulled. When informed that the enemy was at Fleurus in
force, he hesitated long before resolving to move, being crippled by
the inability <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> of his left to move on Quatre Bras and behaving
as if sure that the soldiers before him were only a single corps of
Blücher's army, which he could sweep away at his convenience.
Meanwhile Vandamme had advanced. The Prussians withdrew from Fleurus,
and deployed at the foot of the hillock on which the village of Ligny
stands. When, about midday, Napoleon arrived at Fleurus, he had to
experience the unpleasant surprise of finding a strong force ready to
oppose him. Eighty-seven thousand men, all Blücher's army, except
Bülow's corps and a portion of Ziethen's which had been dispersed by
the right wing and cavalry of the French near Gilly, were drawn up in
battle array to oppose him. This was a loss to the foe of possibly two
thousand men, a serious weakening at a fateful moment. But the Emperor
was not yet ready to meet them, much as he had desired just such a
contingency. He was not aware of the full strength of his enemy, but
he was not sure of annihilating even those he believed to be in
presence, for he had left ten thousand men at Charleroi, under Lobau,
as a reserve, and the troops most available for strengthening his line
were moving toward Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>By the independent action of their own generals a substantial force of
several thousand Dutch-Belgians, virtually the whole of Perponcher's
division, was concentrated at Quatre Bras early that same morning. To
be sure, Wellington had simultaneously determined on the same step,
but it was taken long before his orders arrived. Indeed, he seems to
have reached Quatre Bras before his orderly. Scarcely halting, he
rapidly surveyed the situation and, leaving the troops in command of
the Prince of Orange, rode away to visit Blücher. The two commanders
met at about one o'clock in the windmill of Bry. They parted in the
firm conviction that the mass <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span> of the French army was at
Ligny, and with the verbal understanding that Wellington, if not
himself attacked, would come to Blücher's support. On leaving, the
English commander sharply criticized the tactical disposition of his
ally's army; but Blücher, with the fixed idea that, in any case, the
duke was coming to his aid, determined to stand as he was. With
similar obstinacy, Napoleon, still certain that what he had before
him, although a great force, was only a screen for the retreat of the
main army of the allies, now despatched an order (the second) for Ney
to combine Reille, d'Erlon, and Kellermann in order to destroy
whatever force was in opposition at Quatre Bras. This was at two. The
French attack was opened at half-past two by Gérard and Vandamme; the
resistance was such as to leave no doubt of the real Prussian
strength. This being clear, Napoleon immediately wrote two despatches
of the same tenor&mdash;one he sent to Ney by an aide, and one to d'Erlon
by a subofficer of the guard.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20"><span class="smaller">[20]</span></a> The former (the third for the same
destination) urged Ney to come for the sake of France; the other
summoned d'Erlon from Ney's command to the Emperor's own immediate
assistance: "You will save France, and cover yourself with glory,"
were its closing words. This last order, the original of which has but
lately been revealed, came nigh to ruining the whole day's work.
Before Wellington could return to Quatre Bras, Ney's force was engaged
with the Prince of Orange, and before three o'clock a fierce conflict
was raging at that place. D'Erlon appears to have been in a frightful
quandary as to his duty. He marched away toward St. Amand and in his
dilemma detached his best division, that of Durutte, toward Bry.
Neither superior nor subordinate did anything to the purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> Ney was without the support of an entire corps and did not
therefore literally obey his orders. Napoleon was unassisted by the
wandering force and even confused by their unexpected appearance at a
critical moment. They were mistaken at Ligny for enemies; d'Erlon's
vacillation had so detained them.</p>

<p>Blücher, who was determined to fight, come what would, had held in as
long as his impatient temper permitted; but when no reinforcement from
Wellington appeared, he first fumed, and then about six gave his fatal
orders to prepare for the offensive. The nature of the ground was such
as necessarily to weaken his center by the initial movements. Napoleon
marked this at once, and summoned his guard in order to break through.
For a moment the Emperor hesitated; a mysterious force had appeared on
the left; perhaps they were foes. But when once assured that they were
d'Erlon's men, he waited not an instant longer; at eight the crash
came, and the Prussian line was shattered. Retreat was turned into a
momentary rout so quickly that Blücher could not even exchange his
wounded horse for another, and in the first mad rush he was so stunned
and overwhelmed that his staff gave him up for lost. The few moments
before he was found were the most precious for the allies of the whole
campaign, since Gneisenau directed the flight northward on the line to
Wavre, a route parallel with that on which Wellington, whatever his
success, must now necessarily withdraw. This move, which abandoned
the line to Namur, is Gneisenau's title to fame.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21"><span class="smaller">[21]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> The
lines were quickly formed to carry it out, and the rest of the
retrograde march went on with great steadiness. Napoleon did not wait
until d'Erlon arrived and thereupon order an immediate, annihilating
pursuit, but came to the conclusion that the Prussians were
sufficiently disorganized, and would seek to reorganize on the old
line to the eastward. They were thus, he thought, completely and
finally cut off from Wellington. It was not until early next morning
that he despatched Pajol, with his single cavalry corps, to follow the
foe, for he was confirmed in his fatal conjecture by the false report
of five thousand Prussians having been seen on the Namur road, and
exerting themselves to hold it. The Prussians seen were merely a horde
of stragglers. The truth was not known until next day.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the battle of Ligny was fought that of
Quatre Bras. At eleven Ney received orders outlining a general plan
for the day; about half an hour later came the specific command to
unite the forces of d'Erlon, Reille, and Kellermann, and carry Quatre
Bras; at five arrived in hot haste the messenger with the third order.
At two o'clock there were not quite seven thousand Anglo-Belgians in
Quatre Bras, but, successive bodies arriving in swift succession, by
half-past six o'clock there were over thirty thousand. At two Ney had
seventeen thousand men, and though he sought to recall d'Erlon, yet,
owing to the withdrawal of Durutte, and to d'Erlon's indecision, he
had at half-past six not more than twenty thousand. Not one of
d'Erlon's men had reached him: Girard's division of Reille's corps was
with Vandamme before St. Amand. Gérard's corps had been kept at
Ligny. Had he advanced on the position <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> the previous evening,
or had he attacked between eleven and two on the sixteenth, the event
of the campaign might have been different from what it was. But if he
really believed, as Heymès afterward asseverated was the case, that
his orders were merely to push and hold the enemy, then his conduct
throughout was gallant and correct.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22"><span class="smaller">[22]</span></a> The weight of evidence favors
the claim of Napoleon that the marshal was perverse in his refusal to
take Quatre Bras according to verbal orders. Whatever the truth, the
behavior of Ney's men was admirable when they did advance, but they
were forced back to Frasnes before superior numbers.</p>

<p>Next morning Wellington was conversing with Colonel Bowles when a
staff officer drew up, his horse flecked with foam, and whispered the
news of Ligny. Without a change of countenance, the commander said to
his companion: "Old Blücher has had a &mdash;&mdash; good licking, and gone back
to Wavre, eighteen miles. As he has gone back, we must go, too. I
suppose in England they will say we have been licked. I can't help it;
as they have gone back, we must go, too." Accordingly, he issued his
orders, and his army began to march at ten. On the whole, therefore,
the events of June sixteenth seemed favorable to Napoleon, since,
fighting at two points with inferior numbers, he had been victorious
at one, and had thereby secured the other also. We, of course, know
that by Gneisenau's move this apparent success was rendered nugatory.
It is useless to surmise what would have happened had Bülow been with
Blücher, and d'Erlon and Lobau with Napoleon, or if either of these
possibilities had happened without the other; as it was, Napoleon's
strategy gained both Quatre Bras and Sombreffe.</p>

<p>The Prussians had lost twenty thousand men, missing, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span>
wounded, and dead, and it required vigorous treatment to restore
Blücher. But all night the army marched, and in the morning Bülow,
having found his direction, was near Beauderet and Sauvinières, within
easy reach at Gembloux. The retreat continued throughout the
seventeenth. It was a move of the greatest daring, since the line was
over a broken country almost destitute of roads, and, the old base of
supplies having been abandoned, the men had to starve until Gneisenau
could secure another by way of Louvain. The army bore its hardships
well; there was no straggling or demoralization, and the splendor of
success makes doubly brilliant the move which confounded Napoleon's
plans. Never dreaming at first that his foe had withdrawn elsewhere
than along his natural line of supply toward Liège, the Emperor
considered the separation of the two allies as complete, and after
carefully deliberating throughout the long interval he allowed for
collecting his troops and giving them a thorough rest, he determined
to wheel, join Ney, and attack Wellington, wherever found. It was
serious and inexplicable slackness which he showed in not taking
effective measures to determine immediately where his defeated enemy
was. Being, nevertheless, well aware of the Prussian resources and
character, he made up his mind to detail Grouchy, with thirty-three
thousand men, for the purpose of scouring the country toward Liège at
least as far as Namur. Then, to provide for what he considered a
possible contingency,&mdash;namely, that which had actually occurred,&mdash;this
adjunct army was to turn north, and hasten to Gembloux, in order to
assure absolutely the isolation of Wellington; in any and every case
the general was to keep his communications with Napoleon open.</p>

<p>It was eight in the morning of the seventeenth when Napoleon issued
from his quarters at Fleurus. Flahaut <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> was waiting for the
reply to an inquiry which he had just brought from Ney concerning the
details of Ligny. The Emperor at once dictated a despatch, the most
famous in the controversial literature of Waterloo, in which his own
achievements were told and Ney was blamed for the disconnected action
of his subordinates the previous day; in particular the marshal was
instructed to take position at Quatre Bras, "as you were ordered," and
d'Erlon was criticized for his failure to move on St. Amand. The
wording of the hastily scribbled order to the latter he had probably
forgotten; it was: "Portez-vous ... à la hauteur de Ligny, et fondez
sur St. Amand&mdash;ou vice versa; c'est ce que je ne sais bien." ("Betake
yourself ... to the heights of Ligny, pounce on St. Amand&mdash;or the
reverse; I am not quite sure which.") Further, the Emperor now
declared that, had Ney kept d'Erlon and Reille together, not an
Englishman would have escaped, and that, had d'Erlon obeyed his
orders, the Prussian army would have been destroyed. In case it were
still impossible to seize Quatre Bras with the force at hand, Napoleon
would himself move thither. Then, entering a carriage, he drove to
Ligny; Lobau was ordered at once to Marbais, on the road to Quatre
Bras. After haranguing the troops and prisoners, Napoleon was
informed, about noon, that Wellington was still in position. At once a
second order was sent, commanding Ney to attack; the Emperor, it ran,
was already under way to Marbais. This was not quite true, for while
he was giving detailed instructions to Grouchy before parting, that
general had seemed uneasy, and had finally pleaded that it would be
impossible further to disorganize the Prussians, since they had so
long a start. These scruples were peremptorily put down, and the chief
parted amicably from his subordinate, but with a sense of uneasiness,
lest he had left <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> nice and difficult work in unwilling hands.
Scouts soon overtook him, and expressed doubt as to the Prussians
having gone to Namur. In case they had not, Grouchy must act
cautiously. Accordingly, positive instructions were then dictated to
Bertrand, and sent to Grouchy, whose movements were now doubly
important. The latter general was to reconnoiter toward Namur, but
march direct to Gembloux; his chief task was to discover whether
Blücher was seeking to join Wellington or not. For the rest, he was
free to act on his own discretion.</p>

<p>Napoleon then entered his carriage, and drove to Quatre Bras. Mounting
his horse, he led the pursuit of the English rear. Indignant that Ney
had lost the opportunity to overwhelm at least a portion of
Wellington's force, he exclaimed to d'Erlon, "They have ruined
France!" But he said nothing to Ney himself. So active and energetic
was the Emperor that he actually exposed himself to the artillery fire
with which the English gunners sought to retard the pursuit. It was
not an easy matter for Grouchy to carry out his instructions; at two
o'clock began a steady downpour, which lasted well into the next
morning; the roads to Gembloux were lanes, and the rain turned them
into sticky mud. Not until that night was Grouchy's command assembled
at Gembloux; it was ten o'clock before the leader gained an inkling of
where the Prussians were, and then, though uncertain as to their exact
movements, he immediately despatched a letter, received by Napoleon at
two in the morning. The marshal explained that he would pursue as far
as Wavre, so as to cut off Blücher from Brussels, and to separate him
from Wellington. Some hours later, about seven in the morning, when
finally convinced that the Prussians were retiring on Wavre, Grouchy
set his columns in motion in a straight line <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> toward that
place by Sart-à-Walhain, choosing, with very poor judgment, to advance
by the right bank of the Dyle, and thus jeopardizing the precious
connections he had been repeatedly and urgently instructed to keep
open.</p>

     Orders of Napoleon to Grouchy &mdash; Grouchy's Interpretation of Them

     &mdash; The Battle-field &mdash; Wellington's Position &mdash; Napoleon's Battle
     Array &mdash; His Personal Health &mdash; His Plan.</p>

<p>On the night of June seventeenth Wellington's army reached the heights
at Mont St. Jean, on the northern edge of what was destined to be the
most talked of battle-field in modern times. His retreat, masked by a
strong body of cavalry, with some horse-artillery and a single
infantry division, had been slow and regular, being retarded somewhat
by the heavy rain. Ney had held his position at Frasnes, well aware
that what was before him was far more than a rear-guard&mdash;in fact,
owing to the arrival of strong reinforcements during the night, it was
the larger portion of the Anglo-Belgian army. But the instant the
French marshal was informed of his enemy's retrograde movements he
threw forward a strong force of cavalry to coöperate with Napoleon.
When reunited, the French army numbered seventy-one thousand five
hundred men, with two hundred and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> forty guns, excluding of
course, the whole of Gérard's corps, which had been left at Ligny to
coöperate with Grouchy. That Wellington was far on his way to the
defensive position chosen by himself was probably in accord with
Napoleon's calculations; his only fear was lest his foe should have
withdrawn behind the forest of Soignes, where free communication with
Blücher and the junction of the two allied armies would be assured, as
would not be the case at Mont St. Jean.</p>

<p>This anxiety was set at rest by a cavalry reconnaissance, and at dusk
the French van bivouacked at Belle Alliance, separated by a broad,
shallow vale from their foe. The rest of the army followed with great
difficulty, some by the road; some through plowed or swampy fields,
wading the swollen tributaries of the Dyle, and floundering through
the meadows on their banks. The army of Wellington had seized, in
passing, what provisions and forage they found, and they had
camp-fires to comfort them in the steady rain. The French had scanty
or no rations, and lay throughout the night in the grain-fields,
without fire or shelter. All told, Wellington had sixty-eight thousand
men; ten miles on his right, at Hal, lay eighteen thousand more; ten
miles on his left, twelve from his headquarters at Waterloo, was
Blücher. Wellington, who had informed the Prussian commander that
unless support reached him he would fall back to Brussels, at two
o'clock in the morning had assurance of Blücher's coöperation. There
is an unsupported statement of Napoleon's that he twice sent to
Grouchy on the night of the seventeenth, by two separate officers, a
definite order to detach seven thousand men from his camp at Wavre
(where the Emperor affected to believe that Grouchy was), and make
connection by St. Lambert with the right of the main army. This would
entirely cut off Blücher from Wellington. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> motive of this
statement is transparent&mdash;with the allies separated, they were
outman&oelig;uvered; with the possibility of their union, and an
understanding between them to that effect, he was himself
outman&oelig;uvered.</p>

<p>Grouchy denied having received this order; neither of the officers
intrusted with it ever revealed himself; the original of it has never
been found; and in subsequent orders issued next day there is no
mention of, or reference to, any such message. Either the declaration,
twice made at St. Helena, was due to forgetfulness, being an account
of intentions not carried out, or else it was put forward to explain
the result of the campaign as due to his lieutenant's inefficiency.
Grouchy must have had an uneasy conscience, since for thirty years he
suppressed the text of the Bertrand order, which was not on the
order-book because it had not been dictated to Soult; and when, after
falsely claiming for the duration of an entire generation that he had
acted under verbal instructions, he did publish it, he gave, at the
same time, a mutilated version of his own report from Gembloux, sent
on the night of the seventeenth, changing his original language so as
to show that he had never looked upon the separation of the allies as
his chief task, but that what was uppermost in his mind was an attack
on the Prussians.</p>

<p>It was two in the morning of the eighteenth when the letter of
Grouchy, written about four hours earlier, arrived at Napoleon's
headquarters. Both the Emperor and Soult knew by that time that the
whole of Blücher's army was moving to Wavre; yet they did not give
this information, nor any minute directions, to the returning
messenger. Grouchy, therefore, was left to act on his own discretion,
his superior doubtless believing that the inferior would by that time
himself be fully informed, and would hasten to throw himself, like an
impenetrable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> wall, between the Prussians and the
Anglo-Belgian army. By the defenders of Napoleon Grouchy is severely
criticized for not having marched early in the morning of the
eighteenth to Moustier, where, if energetic, he could have carried
over his army to the left bank of the river by eleven o'clock, thus
placing his force within the sphere of Napoleon's operations. Perhaps
he would have been able to prevent the union of the opposing armies,
or, if not that, to strengthen Napoleon in his struggle. It is proved
by Marbot's memoirs that this is what Napoleon expected. On the other
hand, excellent critics present other very important considerations:
the line to Moustier was over a country so rough and miry that after a
torrential rain the artillery would have been seriously delayed, and
Prussian scouts might well have brought down a strong Prussian column
in time to oppose the crossing there or elsewhere. Grouchy, moreover,
could not know that Wellington would offer battle in front of the
forest of Soignes&mdash;a resolution which, in the opinion of Napoleon and
many lesser experts, was a serious blunder. He appears to have been
positive that the two armies were aiming to combine for the defense of
Brussels; finally, when from Walhain the sound of the firing at
Waterloo was distinctly heard, and Gérard fiercely urged an immediate
march toward the field of battle, Grouchy was acting strictly within
the limits of the Bertrand order, and according to what he then held
to be explicit instructions, when he pressed on to concentrate at
Wavre, and thus, if Napoleon had already defeated Wellington, to
prevent any union between Wellington and the Prussian army. It is
almost certain that Grouchy would in no way have changed the event by
marching direct to Mont St. Jean, for the cross-roads were soaked, his
troops were already exhausted, and the distance was approximately
fourteen and a half <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> miles as the crow flies: the previous day
he had been able to make somewhat less than half that distance in nine
hours.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself did not apparently expect the Prussians to rally as
they did. He spent the hours from dawn, when the rain ceased, in
careful reconnoitering. The mud was so thick in places that he
required help to draw his feet out of his own tracks. At breakfast,
according to a contemporary anecdote, he expressed himself as having
never been more favored by fortune; and when reminded that Blücher
might effect a union with the English, he replied that the Prussians
would need three days to form again. This opinion is in accord with
his exaggerated but reiterated estimates of the disaster produced in
Blücher's ranks after Ligny, and taken in connection with the
difficulty of moving artillery, which is not a sufficient explanation
in itself, affords the only conceivable reason for his delay in
attacking on the eighteenth. It also explains his remissness in
leaving Grouchy to exercise full discretion as to his movements. At
eight the plan of battle was sketched; at nine the orders for the day
were despatched throughout the lines; about ten the weary but
self-confident Emperor threw himself down and slept for an hour; at
eleven he mounted, and rode by the Brussels highway to the farm of
Belle Alliance. It was probably during the Emperor's nap that Soult
forwarded to Grouchy a despatch, marked ten in the morning,
instructing that general to man&oelig;uver toward the main army by way of
Wavre. Although, according to Marbot, Napoleon expected Grouchy in the
afternoon by way of Moustier, at one o'clock a second despatch, of
which the Emperor certainly had cognizance, was forwarded to Grouchy,
expressing approval of his intention to move on Wavre by
Sart-à-Walhain, but instructing him "always to man&oelig;uver in our
direction." <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> The postscript of this second order enjoins
haste, since it was thought Bülow was already on the heights of St.
Lambert.</p>

<p>The one central idea of Napoleon and Soult was clearly to leave a wide
discretion for Grouchy, provided always that he kept his
communications with the main army open, and that his general direction
was one which would insure easy connection, in order either to cut off
or check the Prussians. But, however this may be, the hours of
Napoleon's inactivity were precious to his enemies; by twelve Bülow
was at St. Lambert, and at the same hour two other Prussian corps were
leaving Wavre. These movements were apparently tardy, but Gneisenau,
feeling that Wellington had been a poor reliance at Ligny, and very
much doubting whether he really intended to stand at Waterloo, was
unwilling that Blücher should despatch his troops until it was certain
that the Prussian army would not again be left in the lurch. Should
the Anglo-Dutch retreat to Brussels, the Prussians must either retreat
by Louvain, or be again defeated. Anxiety was not dispelled until the
roar of cannon was heard between eleven and twelve. Then the Prussians
first exerted themselves to the utmost; it was about four when they
were within striking distance, ready to take Napoleon's army on its
flank. When Grouchy reached Wavre, at the same hour, he found there
but one of Blücher's corps, the rear under Thielemann.</p>

<p>Campaign of 1815.<br>
June 15th to 19th.</p>
</div>

<p>From Belle Alliance Napoleon returned, and took his station on the
height of Rossomme. In front was a vale something less than a mile in
width. The highway stretched before him in a straight line until it
skirted the large farmstead of La Haye Sainte on the opposite side;
then, ascending by a slant to the first crest, it passed the hamlet
of Mont St. Jean, only to ascend still <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> higher to the top of
the ridge before falling again into a second depression. At Mont St.
Jean was Wellington's center. The road from Nivelles to Brussels
crosses the valley about a quarter of a mile westward, and on it,
midway between the two slopes, lay another farm-house, with its barns,
that of Hougomont. More than half a mile eastward, in the direction
from which the Prussians were expected, lay scattered the farm
buildings of Papelotte, La Haye, Smohain, and Frischermont. The valley
was covered with rich crops. Unobstructed by ditches or hedges, it was
cut longitudinally about the middle by a cruciform ridge, with spurs
reaching toward Belle Alliance on one side, and past Hougomont on the
other; the road passed by a cut through the longitudinal arm.
Hougomont was almost a fortress, having strong brick walls and a moat;
it stood in a large orchard, which was surrounded by a thick hedge.
The house at La Haye Sainte was brick also, and formed one side of a
quadrangle, inclosed further by two brick barns and a strong wall of
the same material; though not as large or solid as Hougomont, it was a
strong advance redoubt for Mont St. Jean.</p>

<p>The right and center of Wellington were thus well protected, the left
was admirably screened by the places already enumerated. His army was
deployed in three lines, the front plainly visible to the French, the
second partly concealed by the crest of the hill, and the third
entirely so. His headquarters were two miles north, at Waterloo; his
lines of retreat, though broken by the forest of Soignes, were open
either toward Wavre or toward the sea. The latter line was well
protected by the troops at Hal. Uneasy about the character of his
Dutch-Belgian troops, the duke had carefully disposed them among the
reliable English and Germans, in order to preclude the possibility of
a panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> In the foreground of Napoleon's position was the French army,
also deployed in three lines. The front, extending from the mansion of
Frischermont to the Nivelles road, consisted of two infantry corps,
one on each side of Belle Alliance, and of two corps of cavalry, one
on the extreme right wing, one on the left; of this line Ney had
command. The second was shorter, its wings being cavalry, and its
center in two divisions, of cavalry and infantry respectively. The
third, or reserve, was the guard. Each of the lines had its due
proportion of artillery, stationed in all three along the road. This
disposition gave the French array, as seen from beyond, a fan-like
appearance, the sticks, or columns, converging toward the rear. The
array was brilliant; every man and horse was in sight; the number was
superior by about four thousand to that of the enemy; the ground was,
by eleven, almost dry enough to secure the fullest advantage from
superiority in artillery; deserters from the foe came in from time to
time. Surely the moral effect of such a scene upon the somewhat motley
throng across the valley must be very powerful. Yet the road to
Charleroi was the single available line of retreat, and it passed
through a deep cut; the soldiers were tired and not really first-rate,
fifty per cent. of the line being recruits, and nearly a quarter of
the guard untrained men; the tried officers had all been promoted, and
those who replaced them needed such careful watching that deep
formations had been adopted, and these must not merely diminish the
volume of fire, but present vulnerable targets; the cavalry had been
hastily gathered, and was far from being as efficient as the British
veterans of the German legion.</p>

<p>For some moments after reaching his position Napoleon stood impassive.
He was clad in his familiar costume of cocked hat and gray surtout.
Throughout his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> lines he had been received with enthusiasm,
and his presence was clearly magnetic, as of old. The direction of
affairs in this momentous crisis was his, and he dreamed of two
implacable enemies routed, of appeasing the two who were less directly
interested, of glory won, of empire regained. Reason must have told
him how empty was such a vision; for, since the armistice of
Poischwitz, Austria and Russia had been quite as bitter, and more
tortuous, than the other powers. His expression mirrored pain, both
physical and intellectual; his over-confidence and consequent delay
were signs of degenerate power; his exertions for three days past had
been beyond any human strength, especially when the faculties of body
and mind had previously been harassed for more than two months, as his
had been.</p>

<p>It was the first day of the week, but there was a calm more profound
than that of the Sabbath; the sky was dull, the misty air was heavy
with summer heat; but there was the expectant silence of a great host,
the deep determination of two grim and obstinate armies. Wellington,
with his western lines protected, would be safe when the Prussian army
should appear where he knew its van already was, and he must
man&oelig;uver eastward to keep in touch. Napoleon must crush the British
center and left, and roll up the line to its right, in order to
separate the parts of his dual foe. To this end he had determined to
make a feint against Hougomont; should Wellington throw in his
reserves at that point on his right, one strong push might create
confusion among the rest, and hurl the whole force westward, away from
Brussels. It was a simple plan, great in its simplicity, as had been
every strategic conception of Napoleon from the opening of the
campaign. But its execution was like that of every other movement
attempted since the first great march of concentration&mdash;tardy, slack,
and feeble. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> Personal bravery was abundant among the French,
but the orderly coöperation of regiment, division, and corps in all
the arms, the courage of self-restraint, and the self-sacrifice of
individuals in organized movement, with the invigorating ubiquity of a
master mind&mdash;these were lacking from the first.</p>

<p>Napoleon's salute to Wellington was a cannonade from a hundred and
twenty guns. The fire was directed toward the enemy's center and left,
but it was ineffectual, except as the smoke partially masked the first
French movement, which was the attack on Hougomont by their left, the
corps of Reille. This was in three divisions, commanded respectively
by Bachelu, Foy, and the Emperor's brother Jerome, whose director was
Guillemenot. Preceded by skirmishers, the column of Jerome gained
partial shelter in a wood to the southwest of their goal, but the
resistance to their advance was vigorous; on the skirts of the grove
were Nassauers, Hanoverians, and a detachment of the English guards,
all picked men, and behind, on higher ground, was an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> English
battery. The two other divisions pressed on behind, and for a time
their gains were apparently substantial. But, checked in front by
artillery fire, and by a murderous fusillade from loopholes cut in the
walls of Hougomont, the besiegers hesitated. Their fiery energy was
not scientifically directed; but such was their zeal, and so great
were their numbers, that one brigade doubled on the rear of the
fortalice, drove back the English guards from before the entrance to
the courtyard on the north, and charged for the opening. Some of the
French actually forced a passage, and the success of Napoleon's first
move was in sight when five gallant Englishmen, by sheer physical
strength, shut the stout gate in the face of the assailants. A
fearless French grenadier scaled the wall, but he and his comrades
within were killed. A second assault on the same spot failed; so, too,
a third from the west, and still another from the east, all of which
were repelled by the English guards, who moved down from above, and
drove the French into the wood, where they held their own. These close
and bloody encounters were contrary to Reille's orders, but in the
thick of combat his various detachments could not be restrained.</p>

</div>

<p>The second division of the battle was the main attack on Wellington's
left by d'Erlon's corps. Between twelve and one a Prussian hussar was
captured with a message from Blücher to Wellington announcing the
Prussian advance. At once the postscript was added to the second
despatch to Grouchy, already mentioned, and Napoleon made ready for
his great effort. Unable to sit his horse, he had dismounted, and,
seated at the table on which his map was spread, had been frequently
seen to nod and doze. Ney and d'Erlon, left to their own judgment, had
evolved a scheme of formation so complex that when tried, as it now
was, it proved unworkable. The confusion was veiled by a terrific,
continuous, and destructive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> artillery fire. After some delay,
and a readjustment involving preparations against the possible flank
attack of the Prussians, d'Erlon's corps advanced in four columns,
under Donzelot, Allix, Marcognet, and Durutte respectively. Opposed
was Picton's decimated corps, with Bylandt's Dutch-Belgian brigade,
which had been all along a target for the strongest French battery,
one of seventy-eight guns,<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25" title="Go to footnote 25"><span class="smaller">[25]</span></a> and was now to bear the first onset of
the French troops. Bylandt's men had stood firm under the awful
artillery fire, but their uniforms were like those of the French, and
in a mêlée this fact might draw upon them the fire of their own
associates, as later in the day at Hougomont it actually did, and they
grew very uneasy. Durutte, on the extreme right, seized Papelotte, but
lost it almost immediately. The conflict then focused about La Haye
Sainte, where the garden and orchard were seized by an overwhelming
force. The buildings had been inadequately fortified, but Major
Baring, with his garrison, displayed prodigies of valor, and held
them.</p>

<p>The assailants, supported hitherto by batteries firing over their
heads, now charged up the hill; as they reached the crest, their own
guns were silenced, but their yells of defiance rent the air. The
Dutch-Belgians of the first rank harkened an instant, and, followed by
the jeers and menaces of the British grenadiers and Royal Scots, fled
incontinently until they reached a place of safety, when they reformed
and stood. Picton was thus left unsupported, but at that decisive
moment Donzelot tried the new tactics again, and his ranks fell into
momentary confusion. Picton charged, the British artillery opened, and
though the English general fell, mortally wounded, his men hurled back
the French. This first success enabled Wellington to bring in more of
his infantry, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> with the Scots Greys, and to throw in his
cavalry, the First Royal Dragoons and the Enniskillens, for action
against a body of French riders, under Roussel, which, having swept
the fields around La Haye Sainte, was now coming on. His order was for
Somerset and Ponsonby to charge. The shock was terrific, the French
cavalry yielded, and the whole of d'Erlon's line rolled back in
disorder. Efforts were made by the daring Englishmen to create
complete confusion, but they were not entirely successful, for
Durutte's column maintained its formation, while the French lancers
and dragoons wrought fearful havoc among the British infantry somewhat
disorganized by victory. Ponsonby fell among his men, and it was due
to Vandeleur's horse that the French advance was checked. This ended
the effort upon which Napoleon had based his hope of success; there
was still desultory fighting at Hougomont, and the Prussians, though
not visible, were forming behind the forest of Paris.</p>

<p>There was a long and ominous pause before the next renewal of
conflict. Wellington used it to repair his shattered left and brought
in Lambert's Peninsular veterans, twenty-two hundred strong. Napoleon
quickly formed a corps, under Lobau, intended to repel the flank
attack of the Prussians. Ney was determined to redeem his repulse by a
second front attack, and Napoleon, either by word or silence, gave
consent. While the batteries kept up their fire, the marshal gathered
in the center the largest mass of horsemen which had ever charged on a
European battle-field&mdash;twelve thousand men, light and heavy cavalry.
His aim was to supplement Reille, still engaged at Hougomont, and dash
in upon the allied right center. Donzelot's column, now reformed, was
hurled directly against La Haye Sainte, and the mass of the cavalry
surged up the hill. The gunners of Wellington's artillery,
unprotected even by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> breastworks, stood to their pieces until
the attacking line was within forty yards; then they delivered their
final salvo, and fled. Wavering for an instant, the French advanced
with a cheer. Before them stood the enemy in hollow squares, four
ranks deep, the front kneeling, the second at the charge, the two
others ready to fire. The horsemen dared not rush on those bristling
lines. In and out among the serried ranks they flowed and foamed,
discharging their pistols and slashing with their sabers, until,
discouraged by losses and exhausted by useless exertion, their efforts
grew feeble. Dubois's brigade, according to a doubtful tradition,
dashed in ignorance over the brow of a certain shallow ravine, men and
horses rolling in horrid confusion into the unsuspected pit. The
hollow was undoubtedly there at the time, although it has since been
filled up, and, it is believed, was likewise the grave of the fifteen
hundred men and two thousand horses that were eventually collected
from round about. The British reserve cavalry, supported by the
infantry fire and a few hastily collected batteries, completed the
defeat of Ney's first charge. A second was repulsed in the same way.
The undaunted marshal then waited for reinforcements. No fewer than
thirty-seven squadrons came in, Napoleon sending Kellermann's heavy
dragoons as a last resort. Guyot's division of the heavy cavalry of
the guard was also there&mdash;some say they had been summoned by Ney,
others that they came of their own accord; the question arises
because, in the next stage of the battle, their absence from the
station assigned to them was a serious matter. Another time, and still
another, this mighty force moved against the foe. Pouring in and out,
backward and forward, among the squares, they lost cohesion and force
until, in the very moment of Wellington's extremity, they withdrew, as
before, exhausted and spent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> The energy and zeal of the English commander had been in
strange contrast to Napoleon's growing apathy; Wellington had further
strengthened his line by two Brunswick regiments and Mercer's battery,
and at the last by Adam's brigade with the King's Germans under
Dupont. This done, his stand had been superb to the last. Yet he was
now at the end of his resources. It was six, and to his repeated
messages calling for Blücher's aid there had been no response.
Although a portion of Bülow's men had been fighting for more than an
hour, yet the Prussian army was not yet fully engaged and he himself,
having no reinforcement nor relief, seemed face to face with defeat.
Baring had held La Haye Sainte with unsurpassed gallantry; his calls
for men had been answered, but his requisitions for ammunition were
strangely neglected. Ney, seeing how vain his cavalry charges were,
withdrew before the last one took place, arrayed Bachelu's division,
collected a number of field-pieces, and fell furiously, with cannonade
and bayonet charge, upon the farm-house. His success was complete; the
garrison fled, his pursuit was hot, and, leading in person, he broke
through the opposing line at its very heart. Had he been supported by
a strong reserve, the battle would have been won. Müffling,
Wellington's Prussian aide, dashed away to the Prussian lines, and, as
he drew near the head of Ziethen's division, shouted: "The battle is
lost if the corps do not press on and at once support the English
army." Ney's adjutant, demanding infantry to complete the breach he
had made, was received by Napoleon with petulance. One brigade from
Bülow's corps had attacked at about half-past four; repulsed at first,
their onset was growing fiercer, for two other brigades had come in.
Soult had opposed Ney's waste of cavalry. But the latter was
desperate, and with the other generals was displaying a wilfulness
bordering on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> insubordination. A portion of the guard had just
been detached for Lobau's support. To Ney's demand for infantry the
Emperor replied: "Where do you expect me to get them from? Am I to
make them?" In truth, his mind and energies were now more concerned
with Blücher than with Wellington, and he was already fighting the
advance of Bülow in his plans. But had the old Bonaparte spirit moved
the chieftain to put himself at the head of what remained of the guard
infantry, and to make a desperate dash for Ney's support, a temporary
advantage would almost certainly have been won; then, with a remnant
flushed by victory, he could have turned to Lobau's assistance before
the main Prussian army came in. Thus was lost Napoleon's one chance to
deal Wellington a decisive blow.</p>

<p>It was to prevent a dangerous flank movement of the enemy&mdash;the
advance, namely, of Bülow, with the cavalry corps of Prince William,
upon Plancenoit&mdash;that Napoleon had detached the young guard, under
Duhesme, a third of his precious reserve, for the support of Lobau's
right; Durutte being in the rear of his left, that portion was already
as strong as it could be made. Nevertheless the Prussians seized
Plancenoit; at once the French rallied, and drove them out; Blücher
threw in eight fresh battalions, and these, with the six already
engaged, dashed for the ravine leading to the village. The passage was
lined with French, and for a time it was like the valley of Hinnom;
but the Prussians pressed on, and the young guard reeled. Napoleon
sent in two battalions of the old guard, under Morand and Pelet; their
firmness restored that of their comrades, and the place was cleared,
two thousand dead remaining as the victims of that furious charge and
countercharge. At seven Bülow was back again in his first position,
awaiting the arrival of Pirch's corps to restore his riddled ranks.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> Napoleon had now left only twelve of the twenty-three
battalions of the guard reserve, less than six thousand men.
Wellington had repaired the breach made by Ney, and, though still hard
pressed on his right, Ziethen had made good the strength of his left,
whence some of his cavalry, the brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur, had
been detached to repair other weak spots in the line. At this moment
Ziethen conceived that Bülow was further giving way, and hesitated in
his advance. The brief interval was noted by Durutte, and with a last
desperate effort he carried Papelotte, La Haye, and Smohain, hoping to
prevent the fatal juncture. It was half an hour before Ziethen
retrieved his loss, and thus probably saved Wellington's left. By that
time Pirch had come up, and with this reinforcement Bülow, behind the
heavy fire of his powerful batteries, charged Lobau, and advanced on
the guard at Plancenoit. Lobau, the hero of Aspern, stood like a rock
until Durutte's men and the remnants of d'Erlon's corps, flying past
his flank, induced a panic in his ranks. Thereupon the whole French
right fell into confusion: all except the guard, who stood in the
churchyard of Plancenoit until surrounded and reduced in number to
about two hundred and fifty men; then, under Pelet's command, they
formed a square, placed their eagle in the midst, drove off the
cavalry which blocked their path, and reached the main line of retreat
with scarcely enough men to keep their formation. The name of Ziethen
must stand in equal renown with that of Colborne among the annals of
Waterloo. The rout of the French left was the beginning of Napoleon's
calamity, as that of his right under Colborne was its consummation.</p>

<p>Before the combined armies of Wellington and Blücher the French could
not stand; but, in spite of inferior numbers and the manifest signs
of defeat, General <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> Bonaparte might have conducted an orderly
retreat. The case was different with Napoleon the Emperor, even though
he were now a liberator; to retreat would have been merely a
postponement of the day of reckoning. Accordingly, the great
adventurer, facing his destiny on the height at Rossomme, determined,
in a last desperate effort, to retrieve the day, and stake all on a
last cast of the dice. For an instant he appears to have contemplated
a change of front, wheeling for that purpose by Hougomont, where his
resistance was still strong; but he finally decided to crush the
Anglo-Belgian right, if possible; roll up both armies into a confused
mass, so that, perchance, they might weaken rather than strengthen
each other; and then, with Grouchy's aid, strike for victory. Though
indifferent to Ney's demands, he had set in array against Bülow the
very choicest troops of his army; surely they might stand firm while
his blow elsewhere was delivered. But he did not reckon in this with
Wellington's reserve power; though the dramatic stories of the duke's
mortal anxiety rest on slight foundation, there is no doubt that he
felt a great relief when the Prussians entered the combat, for
immediately he turned his attention, not to rest, but to the reforming
of his line. Officers and men, English or German, knew nothing of
Bülow's or Blücher's whereabouts when Napoleon took his resolution;
but, sensible of having been strengthened, they displayed at half-past
seven that evening the same grim determination they had shown at
eleven in the morning. Though Wellington's task of standing firm until
Blücher's arrival was accomplished, and though, perhaps, his soldiers
heard the distant firing of the Prussian guns, yet nothing could be
seen across the long interval, the noise attracted little attention,
and neither he nor they could know what was yet before them. It was,
therefore, splendid courage in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> general and army which kept
them ever ready for any exertion, however desperate.</p>

<p>Against this army, in this temper, Napoleon despatched what was left
of that force which was the peculiar product of his life and genius,
the old and middle guard. Most of its members were the children of
peasants, and had been born in ante-Revolution days. Neither
intelligent in appearance nor graceful in bearing, they nevertheless
had the look of perfect fighting-machines. Their huge bearskin caps
and long mustaches did not diminish the fierceness of their aspect.
They had been selected for size, docility, and strength; they had been
well paid, well fed, and well drilled; they had, therefore, no ties
but those to their Emperor, no homes but their barracks, and no
enthusiasm but their passion for imperial France. They would have
followed no leader unless he were distinguished in their system of
life; accordingly, Ney was selected for that honor; and as they came
in proud confidence up the Charleroi road, their Emperor passed them
in review. Like every other division, they had been told that the
distant roar was from Grouchy's guns; when informed that all was ready
for the finishing-stroke, that there was to be a general advance along
the whole line, and that no man was to be denied his share in certain
victory, even the sick, it is said, rose up, and hurried into the
ranks. The air seemed rent with their hoarse cheers as their columns
swung in measured tread diagonally across the northern spur of the
cruciform elevation which divided the surface of the valley.</p>

<p>Wellington, informed of the French movement, as it is thought by a
deserter, issued hurried orders to the center, ordered Maitland's
brigade to where the charge must be met, and posted himself, with
Napier's battery, somewhat to its right. While yet his words of
warning were scarcely uttered, the head of the French column <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span>
appeared. The English batteries belched forth a welcome; but although
Ney's horse, the fifth that day, was shot, the men he led suffered
little, and with him on foot at their side they came steadily onward.
The British guards were lying behind the hill-crest, and the French
could discern no foe&mdash;only a few mounted officers, of whom Wellington
was one. Astonished and incredulous, the assailants pressed steadily
on until within twenty yards of the English line. "Up, guards! make
ready!" rang out the duke's well-known call. The British jumped up and
fired; about three hundred of Ney's gallant soldiers fell. But there
was no confusion; on both sides volley succeeded volley, and this
lasted until the British charged. Then, and then only, the French
withdrew. Simultaneously Donzelot had fallen upon Alten's division;
but he was leading a forlorn hope, and making no impression.</p>

<p>As Ney fell back, a body of French cuirassiers advanced upon the
English batteries. Their success was partial, and behind them a second
column of the guard was formed. Again the assault was renewed; but the
second attempt fared worse than the first. To the right of Maitland,
Adam's brigade, with the Fifty-second regiment, had taken stand;
wheeling now, these drove a deadly flank fire into the advancing
French, while the others poured in a devastating hail of bullets from
the front. The front ranks of the French replied with spirit, but when
the British had completed their man&oelig;uver, Colborne gave the order,
his men cheered in response, and the countercharge began. "Vive
l'Empereur!" came the responsive cheer from the thinning ranks of the
assailants, and still they came on. But in the awful crash they
reeled, confusion followed, and almost in the twinkling of an eye the
rout began. A division of the old guard, the two battalions under
Cambronne, retreated in fair order to the center of the valley, where
they made <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> their last gallant stand against the overwhelming
numbers of Hugh Halkett's German brigade. They fought until but a
hundred and fifty survived. From far away the despairing cry of "Sauve
qui peut!" seemed to ring on their ears. To the first summons of
surrender the leader had replied with dogged defiance; the second was
made soon after, about three in the afternoon, and to this he yielded.
He and his men filed to the English rear without a murmur, but in deep
dejection. This occurrence has passed into tradition as an epic event;
what Cambronne might well have said, "The guard dies, but never
surrenders," was not uttered by him, but it epitomizes their
character, and in the phrase which seems to have been shouted by the
men themselves in their last desperate struggle, they and their leader
have found immortality.</p>

<p>The last charge of what remained of the guard took place almost at the
moment when Durutte was finally routed. Wellington then sent in the
fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur against the column of
Donzelot and the remnants of the French cavalry. These swept all
before them, and then the duke gave the order for a general advance.
The French left fell into panic, and fled toward Belle Alliance.
Before La Haye Sainte stood two squares of French soldiers, the
favored legion chosen to protect the imperial headquarters. In the
fatal hour it splendidly vindicated the choice, and amid the chaos
stood in perfect order. Throughout the famous charge of his devoted
men Napoleon rode hither and thither, from Rossomme to Belle Alliance.
His looks grew dark, but at the very last he called hoarsely to the
masses of disorganized troops that came whirling by, bidding them to
stand fast. All in vain; and as the last square came on he pressed
inside its serried wall. It was not too soon, for the Prussians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> had now joined the forward movement, and in the supreme
disorder consequent the other square dissolved. Napoleon's convoy
withstood the shock of a charge from the Twelfth British light
dragoons, and again of a Prussian charge at Rossomme, where Gneisenau
took up the fierce pursuit. Though assaulted, and hard beset by
musketry, the square moved silently on. There were no words except an
occasional remark addressed by Napoleon to his brother Jerome, or to
one of the officers. At eleven Genappe was reached; there, such was
the activity of the pursuers, all hope of an orderly retreat vanished,
and the square melted away. Napoleon had become an object of pity&mdash;his
eyes set, his frame collapsed, his great head rolling in a drowsy
stupor. Monthyon and Bertrand set him as best they could upon a horse,
and, one on each side, supported him as they rode. They had an escort
of forty men. At Quatre Bras they despatched a messenger to summon
Grouchy, bidding him to retire on Namur. The Prussians were only one
hour behind. At daybreak the hunted Emperor reached Charleroi, but his
attendants dared not delay; two rickety carriages were secured, and it
was not until the wretched caravan reached Philippeville that the
fugitives obtained a few hours' repose.</p>

<p>The battle of Waterloo is so called because Wellington's despatch to
England was dated from his headquarters at that place. The world-wide
celebrity of the fight was due to the failure of a tremendous cause
and the extinction of a tremendous genius. That genius had been so
colossal as to confuse human judgment. Even yet mankind forgets that
its possessor was a finite being and attributes his fall to any cause
except the true one. Western Europe had paid dearly for the education,
but it had been educated, learning his novel and original methods in
both war and diplomacy. We have followed the gradual decline of the
master's ability, physical, mental, and moral; we have noted the rise
of the forces opposed to him, military, diplomatic, and national.
Waterloo is a name of the highest import because it marks the final
collapse of personal genius, the beginning of reaction toward an order
old in name but new in spirit. Waterloo was not great by reason of the
numbers engaged, for on the side of the allies were about a hundred
and thirty thousand men, on the other seventy-two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> thousand
approximately; nor was there any special brilliancy in its conduct.
Wellington defended a strong position well and carefully selected. But
he wilfully left himself with inferior numbers; he did not heartily
coöperate with Blücher; both were unready; Gneisenau was suspicious;
and the battle of Ligny was a Prussian blunder. Napoleon committed,
between dawn and dusk of June eighteenth, a series of petty mistakes,
each of which can be explained, but not excused. He began too late; he
did not follow up his assaults; he did not retreat when beaten; he
could attend to only one thing at a time; he failed in control of his
subordinates; he was neither calm nor alert. His return from Elba had
made him the idol of the majority in France, but his conduct
throughout the Hundred Days was that of a broken man. His genius
seemed bright at the opening of his last campaign, but every day saw
the day's task delayed. His great lieutenants grew uneasy and
untrustworthy, though, like his patient, enduring, and gallant men,
they displayed prodigies of personal valor. Ney and Grouchy used their
discretion, but it was the discretion of caution most unlike that of
Desaix at Marengo, or of Ney himself at Eylau. Their ignorance cannot
be condoned; Grouchy's decision at Walhain, though justified in a
measure by Soult's later order, was possibly the immediate cause of
final disaster. But such considerations do not excuse Napoleon's
failure to give explicit orders, nor his nervous interference with
Ney's formation before Quatre Bras, nor his deliberate iterations
during his captivity that he had expected Grouchy throughout the
battle. Moreover, the interest of Waterloo is connected with its
immediate and dramatic consequences rather than with its decisive
character. If Napoleon had won on that day, the allies would have
been far from annihilation; both Wellington and Blücher <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> had
kept open their respective lines of retreat. The national uprising of
Europe would have been more determined than ever; 1815 would have been
but a repetition of 1814. Finally, the losses, though terrible, were
not unparalleled. Grouchy won at Wavre, and, hearing of the disaster
at Mont St. Jean, first contemplated falling on the Prussian rear as
they swept onward in pursuit. But he quickly abandoned this chimerical
idea, and on receipt of Napoleon's order from Quatre Bras, withdrew to
Namur, and thence, by a masterly retreat, conducted his army back into
France. Including those who fell at Wavre, the allies lost about
twenty-two thousand five hundred men, of whom seven thousand were
British and a like number Prussians. The records at Paris are very
imperfect, but they indicate that the French losses were about
thirty-one thousand.</p>

<p>The booty captured after Waterloo was unimportant; but the political
spoils were immense, and they belonged to the Prussians. Their high
expectation of seizing Napoleon's person was disappointed; but the one
great result&mdash;the realization, namely, of all the tyrannical plans
formed at Vienna for the humiliation of liberal France&mdash;that they
secured by their instant, hot pursuit. It is hard to discern the facts
in the dust of controversy. Prussia, Austria, Russia, and Great
Britain have each the national conviction of having laid the Corsican
specter; France has long been busy explaining the facts of her defeat,
but seems to have at last completed the task; the most conspicuous
monument on the battle-field is that to the Dutch-Belgians!</p>

<p>Napoleon was fully aware that at Waterloo he had made the last cast of
the dice and that he had lost. It cannot be proven, but the charge is
made, that far earlier he had ceased to reckon with facts and had
begun to juggle with unrealities. The return from Elba has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span>
all the elements of romance, but events proved that it was based on a
sound judgment. Had the allied powers been willing to give France the
privilege of choosing her own government, which in spite of all that
had occurred was hers by every principle known to international law,
Europe would have enjoyed some years of repose, at any rate;
considering Napoleon's shattered health and premature old age, France
might for a long period have ceased to be a disturber of the public
peace, working out then as now, perhaps in equal tribulation, the
enduring principles of the Revolution; forty years of turmoil might
have been spared to the Continent and the gory floods poured on the
ground at Quatre Bras, Ligny, and Waterloo might have coursed
unmolested in the veins of the innocent men from which they welled
out. The responsibility for all the blood which was shed after the
first treaty of Paris must be shared with Napoleon by dynastic Europe,
in particular by the diplomatists who represented the hate of Russia,
Austria, and Prussia and suffered it to find an outlet in a war of
revenge; a portion too belongs to the factious bitterness which
reigned supreme in the various French parties, awakening civil strife
and endangering French nationality. From first to last there had been
little consistency or continuity in Napoleon's character&mdash;it is by no
means certain that he might not well have played, and perhaps
magisterially, the rôle of a national ruler; it is of course also
possible that he might have remained the same untamed, cosmopolitan
adventurer to the end. In view of the political history of France
during the Hundred Days, the former is more probable. But after
Waterloo he was clearly aware that he could no longer be either the
one or the other. It was not to be expected that every instinct would
disappear at once, that he would resign himself to obscurity without
an effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> After a short rest at Philippeville, Napoleon composed the
customary bulletins concerning his campaign, and despatched them to
the capital, together with a letter counseling Joseph to stand firm
and keep the legislature in hand. If Grouchy had escaped, he wrote, he
could already array fifty thousand men on the spot; with the means at
hand, he could soon organize a hundred and fifty thousand; the troops
in regimental depots, together with the national guard, would raise
the number to three hundred thousand. These representations were based
on a habit of mind, and not on genuine conviction. He believed
Grouchy's force to have been annihilated, and though he paused at Laon
as if to reorganize an army, he went through the form of consulting
such officers as he could collect, and then, under their advice,
pressed on to Paris. The officers urged that the army and the majority
of the people were loyal, but that the aristocracy, the royalists, and
the liberal deputies were utterly untrustworthy. "My real place is
here," was the response. "I shall go to Paris, but you drive me to a
foolish course." This was the voice of reason, but he obeyed the
behest of inclination. Yet he halted at the threshold, and, entering
the city on the night of June twenty-first, made no public
announcement of his presence. On the contrary, he almost slunk into
the silent halls of the Élysée, where a sleepy attendant or two
received the unexpected guest without realizing what had happened. He
must have felt that the moral effect of Waterloo had been his undoing;
unlike any other of his defeats, it had not ruined him as general
alone, nor as ruler alone: his prestige as both monarch and soldier
was gone.</p>

<p>The news of Ligny had been received in the city with jubilations; at
the instant of Napoleon's arrival the truth about Mont St. Jean was
passing all too swiftly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> on the thousand tongues of rumor from
quarter to quarter throughout the town, creating consternation
everywhere. Early in the morning, Davout, fully aware of public
sentiment, and true to his instincts, advised the shrinking Emperor to
prorogue the chambers, and throw himself on the army; Carnot believed
the public safety required a dictatorship, and urged it; Lucien was
strongly of the same opinion. But the old Napoleon was no more;
vacillating almost as if in partial catalepsy, murmuring empty phrases
in quick, indistinct utterance, he refused to decide. Members of the
council began to gain admittance, and, waxing bolder as Napoleon grew
more silent, the word "abdication" was soon on every tongue. At last a
decision was taken, and such a one! Lucien was sent to parley with the
chambers, and Fouché was summoned. The latter, with insidious
eloquence, argued that in the legislature alone could Napoleon find a
support to his throne. The talk was reported, as if by magic, in the
assembly halls, and Lafayette, supported by Constant, put through a
motion that any attempt to dissolve the chambers would be considered
treason. Lucien pleaded in vain for a commission to treat with the
invaders in his brother's name; the deputies appointed a committee of
public safety, and adjourned.</p>

<p>Broken in spirit, Napoleon spent the evening in moody speculation,
weighing and balancing, but never deciding. Should he appear at dawn
before the Tuileries, summon the troops already in Paris, and prorogue
the hated chambers, or should he not? The notion remained a dream.
Early in June the court apothecary, Cadet de Gassicourt, had been
ordered by the Emperor to prepare an infallible poison. This was done,
and during this night of terrible vacillation the dose was swallowed
by the desperate fugitive. But, as before at Fontainebleau, the
theory of the philosopher was weaker than his instincts. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> In
dreadful physical and mental agony, the would-be suicide summoned his
pharmacist, and was furnished with the necessary antidotes. But the
morning brought no courage, and when the chambers met at their
accustomed hour, on the motion of an obscure member they demanded the
Emperor's abdication. The message was borne by the military commander
of the Palais Bourbon, where the legislature, which had now usurped
the supreme power, was sitting, and he asserted of his own motion
that, if compliance were refused, the chambers would declare Napoleon
outlawed. The Emperor at first made a show of fierce wrath, but in the
afternoon he dictated his final abdication to Lucien. No sooner was
this paper received than the wild excitement of the deputies and peers
subsided, and at once a new Directory, consisting of Carnot, Fouché,
Caulaincourt, and Quinette, took up the reins of government. The city
acquiesced, and hour after hour nothing interrupted the deep seclusion
of the Élysée, except occasional shouts from passing groups of
working-men, calling for Napoleon as dictator.</p>

<p>But there was a change as the stragglers from Waterloo began to
arrive, vowing that they still had an arm for the Emperor, and
denouncing those whom they believed to have betrayed him. The notion
of sustaining Napoleon by force began to spread, and when the soldiers
who were coming in, after suppressing the insurrection in Vendée,
added their voices to those of their comrades from Waterloo, the new
authorities feared Napoleon's presence as a menace to their power.
Davout had been the first to suggest an appeal to force, but when
Napoleon recurred at last to the idea, the marshal opposed it. On June
twenty-fifth, therefore, the fallen man withdrew to Malmaison; where,
in the society of Queen Hortense and a few faithful friends, during
three days <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> he abandoned himself for long intervals to the sad
memories of the place. But he also wrote a farewell address to the
army, and, in constant communication with a committee of the
government, completed a plan for escaping to the United States, "there
to fulfil his destiny," as he himself said. For this purpose two
frigates were put at the disposal of "him who had lately been
Emperor." All was ready on the twenty-ninth. That day a passing
regiment shouted, "Long life to the Emperor," and, in a last
despairing effort, Napoleon sent an offer of his services, as a simple
general, to save Paris, and defeat the allies, who, though approaching
the capital, were now separated. Fouché returned an insulting answer
to the effect that the government could no longer be responsible for
the petitioner's safety. Then, at last, Napoleon knew that all was
over in that quarter. Clad in civilian's clothing, and accompanied by
Bertrand, Savary, and Gourgaud, he immediately set out for Rochefort.
General Becker led the party as commissioner for the provisional
government.</p>

<p>It was the exile's intention to hurry onward, but at Rambouillet he
halted, and spent the evening composing two requests, one for a supply
of furniture from Paris, the other for the library in the Petit
Trianon, together with copies of Visconti's "Greek Iconography" and
the great work on Egypt compiled from materials gathered during his
ill-starred sojourn in that country. Next morning a courier arrived
from Paris with news. "It is all up with France," he exclaimed, and
set out once more. Crowds lined the highways; sometimes they cheered,
and they were always respectful. Such was the enthusiasm of two
cavalry regiments at Niort that Becker was induced to send a despatch
to the government, pleading that an army, rallied in Napoleon's name,
might still exert an important influence in public affairs. Just as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> the general was closing the document there arrived the news
of the cannonade heard before the capital on the thirtieth. Napoleon
dictated a postscript: "We hope the enemy will give you time to cover
Paris and bring your negotiations to an issue. If, in that case, an
English cruiser stops the Emperor's departure, you can dispose of him
as a common soldier."</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence, English cruisers had, as a matter of fact,
appeared within a few days in the offing before Rochefort. Whatever
the relation between this circumstance and his suggestion, Napoleon
studied every possible means of delaying his journey, and actually
opened a correspondence with the commanders in Bordeaux and the
Vendée, with a view to overthrowing the "traitorous" government. It
was July third when he finally reached Rochefort. Again for five days
he procrastinated. But the allies were entering Paris; Wellington was
bringing Louis XVIII back to his throne; in forty-eight hours the
monarchs of the coalition would arrive. Blücher had commissioned a
Prussian detachment to seize and shoot his hated opponent, wherever
found. On the eighth, therefore, the outcast Emperor embarked; but for
two days the frigates were detained by unfavorable winds. On the
tenth, English cruisers hove in sight, and on the eleventh Las Cases,
who had been appointed Napoleon's private secretary, was sent to
interview Captain Maitland, of the <i>Bellerophon</i>, concerning his
instructions from the British government. The envoy returned, and
stated that the English commander would always be ready to receive
Napoleon, and conduct him to England, but he could not guarantee that
the ex-Emperor could settle there, or be free to betake himself to
America.</p>

<p>This language was almost fatal to the notion of a final refuge in
England, which Napoleon had begun to discuss <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> and consider
during the days spent in Rochefort; so Las Cases sought a second
interview. According to his account, Maitland then changed his tone,
remarking that in England the monarch and his ministers had no
arbitrary power; that the generosity of the English people, and their
liberal views, were superior to those entertained by sovereigns. To
the speaker this was a platitude; to the listeners it was a weighty
remark. A prey to uncertainty, Napoleon entertained various schemes.
He bought two small, half-decked fishing-boats, with a view to
boarding a Danish ship that lay outside, but the project was quickly
dropped. Two young officers of the French frigate suggested sailing
all the way to New York in the little craft. Napoleon seriously
considered the possibility, but recalling that such vessels must get
their final supplies on the coasts of Spain or Portugal, rejected the
plan, for he dared not risk falling into the hands of embittered foes.
Word was brought that an American ship lay near by, in the Gironde.
General Lallemand galloped in hot haste to see whether an asylum for
the outlawed party could be secured under her flag. He returned with a
reply that the captain would be "proud and happy to grant it."</p>

<p>But in the interim Napoleon had determined to throw himself on the
"generosity of England." On the thirteenth Gourgaud was sent to
London, with a request to the Prince Regent that the Emperor should be
permitted to live unknown in some provincial English place, under the
name of General Duroc. On the fifteenth Napoleon embarked on the
<i>Bellerophon</i>, where he was received with all honors; next day the
vessel sailed, and on the twenty-fourth she cast anchor in Torbay.
During the voyage the passenger was often somnolent, and seemed
exhausted; but he was affable in his intercourse with the officers,
and to Maitland, who unwisely yielded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> the expected
precedence. To his kindly keeper, in a sort of beseeching confidence,
the prisoner showed portraits of his wife and child, lamenting with
tender sensibility his enforced separation from them. The scenes in
Torbay were curious. Crowds from far and near lined the shores, and
boats of all descriptions thronged the waters; the sight-seers dared
everything to catch a glimpse of the awful monster under the terrors
of whose power a generation had reached manhood. If, perchance, they
succeeded, the air was rent with cheers. After two days the ship was
ordered round into Plymouth Sound, but the reckless sensation-seekers
gathered there in still greater numbers.</p>

<p>Many have wondered at Napoleon's surrender of his person to the
English. There was no other course open which seemed feasible to a
broken-spirited man in his position. His admirers are correct in
thinking that it was more noble for him to have survived his greatness
than to have taken his own life. To have entered on a series of
romantic adventures such as were suggested&mdash;concealment on the Danish
vessel, flight in open boats, concealment in a water-cask on an
American merchantman, and the like&mdash;would have been merely the
addition of ignominy to his capture; for his presence under the
American flag would have been reported by spies, and at that day the
standard of the United States would have afforded him little immunity.
It is possible that on the morrow of Waterloo Napoleon might, with
Grouchy's army, the other survivors, and the men from Vendée, have
reassembled an army in Paris, but it is doubtful. Nothing in
Revolutionary annals can surpass the horror of royalist frenzy, known
as the White Terror, which broke out in Provence and southern France
on receipt of the news from Waterloo. The ghastly distemper spread
swiftly, and when Napoleon embarked the tricolor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> was floating
only at Rochefort, Nantes, and Bordeaux; his family was proscribed,
Ney and Labédoyère were imprisoned and doomed to execution. To have
surrendered either to Wellington or Blücher would have been seeking
instant death; to have collected such desperate soldiers as could be
got together would have been an attempt at guerrilla warfare. To take
refuge with the officers of England's navy was the only dignified
course with any element of safety in it, since Great Britain was the
only land in Europe which afforded the privileges of asylum to certain
classes of political offenders. Naturally, the negotiators did not
proclaim their extremity. Considering the date of Gourgaud's embassy,
it is clear they were in no position to demand formal terms, and
Maitland's character forbids the conclusion that he made them. It is
unfortunate that he did not commit to writing all his transactions
with Lallemand, Savary, and Las Cases; perhaps he was injudiciously
polite, but it is certain that, contrary to their representations, he
made no promise, even by implication, that under England's flag
Napoleon should find a refuge, and not a prison.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1815-21</p>

<p>The ministry of Lord Liverpool, though ultra-Tory, was nevertheless
embarrassed by the course of affairs. On June twentieth the premier
wrote to Castlereagh that he wished Napoleon had been captured by
Louis XVIII, and executed as a rebel. This amazing suggestion was the
result of the progress made within a year by the doctrine of
legitimacy. Although Talleyrand had observed the Hundred Days from the
safe seclusion of Carlsbad, and was coldly received by his
"legitimate" sovereign when he returned to Paris under Wellington's
ægis, yet there was no one equally able to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> restore a
"legitimate" government, and, with the aid of Wellington, who assumed
without question the chief place in reconstructing France, he was soon
in full activity. In strict logic, the allies reasoned that Napoleon
was their common prisoner, and, as the chief malefactor, he should
meet the fate which was to be Ney's, and later that of Murat. By long
familiarity with such notions, the Czar had finally been converted to
the once abhorrent idea of legitimacy, and was hatching the scheme of
the Holy Alliance; even he would have made no objection. But English
opinion, however irritated, would not tolerate the idea of death as a
penalty for political offenses. Whatever ministers felt or said, they
dared consider no alternative in dealing with Napoleon except that of
imprisonment. Accordingly, St. Helena, the spot suggested at Vienna as
being the most remote in the habitable world, was designated and the
island was borrowed from the East India Company. Acts of Parliament
were passed which established a special government for it, and cut it
off from all outside communication, "for the better detaining in
custody Napoleon Bonaparte." The Continental allies, therefore, on
August second, declared the sometime Emperor to be their common
prisoner. To England they yielded the right to determine his place of
detention, but to each of themselves&mdash;Austria, Russia, and
Prussia&mdash;was reserved the right of sending thither a commissioner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> who should determine the fact of actual imprisonment.</p>

<p>It was in Torbay that the newspapers brought on board the
<i>Bellerophon</i> first announced what was under consideration. On July
thirty-first, with inconsistent ceremony, the determination was
formally announced by an embassy consisting of Lord Keith, the
admiral; Sir Henry Bunbury, an under-secretary of state; and Mr.
Meike, secretary to the admiral. To whom did this highest official
authority address itself? To General Bonaparte, a private citizen!
Their message was read in French, and Napoleon displayed perfect
self-control. Asked if he had anything to say, the ex-Emperor, without
temper or bitterness, appealed against the judgment of governments
both to posterity and to the British people. He was, he said, a
voluntary guest; he wished to be received as such under the law of
nations, and to be domiciled as an English citizen (<i>sic</i>). During the
interval before naturalization he would dwell under superintendence
anywhere in England, thirty leagues from any seaport. He could not
live in St. Helena; he was accustomed to ride twenty miles a day; what
could he do on that little rock at the end of the world? He could have
gone to his father-in-law, or to the Czar, but while the tricolor was
still flying he had confided in British hospitality. Though defeated,
he was still a sovereign, and deserved to be treated as such. With
emphasis he declared that he preferred death to St. Helena.</p>

<p>The embassy withdrew in silence from the moving scene. Lord Keith had
previously expressed gratitude to Napoleon for personal attentions to
a young relative who had been captured at Waterloo. Him, therefore,
the imperial prisoner now recalled, and asked if there were any
tribunal to which appeal might be made. The answer was a polite
negative, with the assurance that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> the British government
would mitigate the situation as far as prudence would permit. "How
so?" said Napoleon. "Surely St. Helena is preferable to a smaller
space in England," answered Keith, "or being sent to France, or
perhaps to Russia." "Russia!" exclaimed Napoleon, taken off his guard.
"God preserve me from it!" This was the only moment of excitement; the
witnesses of the long and trying scene have left on record the
profound impression made on them by Napoleon's dignity and admirable
conduct throughout. Subsequently the prisoner composed a written
protest appealing to history. An enemy who for twenty years had waged
war against the English people had come voluntarily to seek an asylum
under English laws; how did England respond to such magnanimity? In
his own mind, at least, he instituted and therefore wrote a comparison
between-himself and Themistocles, who took refuge with the Persians,
and was kindly treated. The parallel broke down in that the great
Greek had never forced his enemy into entangling alliances, as
Napoleon had forced England into successive coalitions for
self-preservation. Moreover, his surrender was not voluntary: his life
would not have been worth a moment's purchase either in France or
elsewhere on the Continent, to have fled by sea would have been to
invite capture. "Wherever," as he himself repeatedly said&mdash;"wherever
there was water to float a ship, there was to be found a British
standard." Still there were many in England who took his view; much
sympathy was aroused, and some futile efforts for his release were
made.</p>

<p>For the journey to St. Helena, Napoleon was transferred to Admiral
Cockburn's ship, the <i>Northumberland</i>. The suite numbered thirty, and
was chosen by Napoleon himself. Its members were Bertrand, Montholon,
and Las Cases, with their families, together with Gourgaud <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span>
and, following in a later ship, a Pole of doubtful duty and dubious
personality, the self-styled Colonel Piontkowski. There were sixteen
servants, of whom twelve were Napoleon's. The voyage was tedious and
uneventful. The admiral adhered to English customs, and discarded the
etiquette observed toward crowned heads; but he remained on the best
of terms with his illustrious prisoner. There were occasional
misunderstandings, and sometimes ill-natured gossip, in which the
admiral was denounced behind his back as a "shark"; but such little
gusts of temper passed without permanent consequences. Napoleon had
secured the excellent library he desired, and every day read or wrote
during most of the morning; the evenings he devoted to games of hazard
for low stakes, or to chess, which he played very badly. He was
careful as to his diet, took abundant regular exercise, and, since his
health was excellent, he appeared in the main cheerful and resigned.</p>

<p>The island of St. Helena is the craggy summit of an ancient volcano,
rising two thousand seven hundred feet above the sea, and contains
forty-five square miles. Its shores are precipitous, but it has an
excellent harbor, that of Jamestown, which was then a port of call on
the voyage from England, by the Cape of Good Hope, to India. It lies
four thousand miles from London, one thousand one hundred and forty
from the coast of Africa, one thousand one hundred and eighty from the
nearest point in South America. There were a few thousand inhabitants
of mixed race, and the tropical climate, though moist and enervating,
is fairly salubrious. Under the act passed by Parliament, England
increased the territorial waters around the island to a ring three
times the usual size, and policed them by "hovering" vessels, which
made the approach of suspicious craft virtually impossible. This,
with numerous other precautionary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> measures of minor
importance, made St. Helena an impenetrable jail. It was October
sixteenth, 1815, when Napoleon landed on its shores.</p>

<p>The residence provided for the imperial captive was a rather ordinary
farm-house in the center of the island, on a plateau two thousand feet
high. The grounds were level, and bounded by natural limits, so that
they were easy to guard, and could be observed in all their extent by
sentries; eventually a circuit of twelve miles was marked out, and
within this the prisoner might move at will; if he wished to pass the
line, he must be attended by an English officer. Considering the
conceptions of state and chivalry then prevalent, the place was mean;
long after, when enlarged and repaired, the house was thought not
unsuitable for the entertainment of an imprisoned Zulu chieftain.
Longwood, for this is the familiar name, might at a pinch have
sufficed for the lodging of General Bonaparte; it was certainly better
than a dungeon; but its modest comfort was far from the luxurious
elegance which had become a second nature to the Emperor Napoleon.
Such as it was to be, however, it was still uninhabitable in October,
and its destined occupant was, until December ninth, the guest of a
hospitable merchant, Mr. Balcombe, at his villa known as The Briars.
The sentinels and patrols remained six hundred paces from the door
during the day; at night the cordon of guards was drawn close around
the house; twice in twenty-four hours the orderly must assure himself
of the prisoner's actual presence, and human ingenuity could devise no
precaution which was not taken by land and sea to make impossible any
secret communication, inward or outward. Cockburn's serene good-nature
rendered it out of the question for the captive to do more than
declare his policy of protest and exasperation, until April, 1816,
when the admiral departed, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> was replaced by Sir Hudson
Lowe. The latter was a vulnerable foe. A creature of routine, and
fresh from a two years' residence as English commissioner in Blücher's
camp, he had thoroughly absorbed the temper both of the Tory ministry
and of the Continental reactionaries. Neither irascible, severe, nor
ill-natured, he was yet punctilious, and in no sense a match for the
brilliant genius of his antagonist. With the arrival of this
unfortunate official properly begins the St. Helena period of
Napoleon's life&mdash;a period considered by many to be instructive; but,
as regards the talk and futile calculations in which he indulged,
comparable only to that of his ineffectual agitations in Corsica.</p>

</div>

<p>Napoleon, the prisoner, had a double object&mdash;release and
self-justification. The former he hoped to gain by working on the
feelings of the English Liberals; the latter by writing an
autobiography which, in order to win back the lost confidence of
France, should emphasize the democratic, progressive, and beneficent
side of his career, and consign to oblivion his tyrannies and
inordinate personal ambitions. The dreary chronicle of the quarrel
between a disarmed giant and a potent pygmy is uninteresting in
detail, but very illuminating in its large outlines. The routine of a
court was instituted and for a time was rigidly observed at Longwood.
The powerless monarch so successfully simulated the wisdom and
judgment of a chastened soul that the accounts which reached the
distant world awakened a great pity among the disinterested. As on
shipboard and at The Briars, he gave his mornings to literature, clad
in a studied, picturesque dishabille. The afternoon he devoted to
amusement and exercise; but a distaste for more physical exertion than
was actually essential to health grew steadily, until he became
sluggish and corpulent. At table he was always abstemious; his sleep
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> irregular and disturbed. The evenings he spent with
favorite authors, Voltaire, Corneille, and Ossian; frequently, also,
in reading the Bible. The opinions he expressed were in the main those
of his pseudoscientific days; among other questions discussed was that
of polygamy, which he upheld as an excellent institution
theoretically. Much time was spent by the household in abusing
Longwood, and so effectually that a wooden house was constructed in
England, and erected near by; but the prisoner made difficulties about
every particular, and never occupied it. There were continuous
schemings for direct intercourse with friends in France, and partial
success ended in the dismissal of Las Cases. Gourgaud, too, departed,
ostensibly because of a quarrel with Montholon, really, as he
represented, to agitate with Alexander, Francis, and Maria Louisa for
Napoleon's release. The exile confessed, in an unguarded moment, that
no man alive could have satisfied him in the relation of governor of
St. Helena, but yet he was adroit and indefatigable in his efforts to
discredit Lowe. The "Letters from the Cape of Good Hope," published in
England anonymously, but now incorporated in the official edition of
Napoleon's works as the thirty-first volume, abuse the climate of St.
Helena, depict the injustice of the imprisonment, and heap scorn on
the governor. The book was widely read, and furnished the Whigs in
Parliament with many shafts of criticism. This success emboldened the
author, and further compositions by his hand were mysteriously
published in Europe.</p>

<p>For three years Napoleon's self-appointed task as a historian was
unremittingly pursued, and the results, while he had the assistance of
Las Cases and Gourgaud, were voluminous; thereafter the output was a
slender rill. Most of the volumes which record his observations and
opinions bear the names of the respective memorialists, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span>
Montholon, Las Cases, Gourgaud, O'Meara, and Antommarchi, the two
latter his attendant physicians. The period he took pains to elucidate
most fully in these writings was that between Toulon and Marengo. Over
his own name appeared monographs on Elba, the Hundred Days, and
Waterloo. His professional ability is shown by short studies on the
"Art and History of War," on "Army Organization," and on
"Fortification"; likewise by his full analyses of the wars waged by
Cæsar, Turenne, and Frederick the Great. These are not unworthy of the
author's reputation; his versatility is displayed in a few commonplace
notes&mdash;some on Voltaire's "Mahomet," some on suicide, and others on
the second book of the Æneid. A widely circulated treatise, the
"Manuscript from St. Helena," was long attributed to him, but was a
clever forgery. As will be explained, its effect on history was
important.</p>

<p>For nearly four years Napoleon's health was fair. O'Meara, the
physician appointed to attend him, was assiduous and skilful, but when
he became his patient's devoted slave he was dismissed by Lowe.
Thereupon certain disquieting symptoms, which had been noted from time
to time, became more pronounced, and the prisoner began to brood and
mope in seclusion. In the autumn of 1819, Dr. Antommarchi, a Corsican
physician chosen by Fesch, was installed at Longwood. For a time, as
he claimed, he had some success in ameliorating the ex-Emperor's
condition, and to what the writer records as their confidential talks
we owe our knowledge of Napoleon's infancy. But from month to month
the patient's strength diminished, and the ravages of his mysterious
disease at length became very apparent. The obstinacy of Lowe in
carrying out the letter of his instructions, by intruding on the
sufferer to secure material for a daily report, seriously aggravated
Napoleon's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> miseries. Two priests accompanied Antommarchi: one
only remained for some time, and after his arrival mass was celebrated
almost every morning in the chapel adjoining the sick-room. "Not every
man is an atheist who would like to be," was a remark Napoleon dropped
to Montholon. Yet, though preparing for death, he was making ready
simultaneously to speed his Parthian arrow.</p>

<p>His testament displays his qualities in their entirety. The language
sounds simple and sincere; there is a hidden meaning in almost every
line. His religion had been outwardly that of a deist; he now
professed a piety which he always felt but rarely practised. During
his life France had been caressed and used as a skilful artificer
caresses and uses his tools; the last words of his will suggest a
passionate devotion. To his son he recommended the "love of right,
which alone can incite to the performance of great deeds"; for his
faithless wife he expressed the tenderest sentiments, and probably
felt them. It was his hope that the English people would avenge itself
on the English oligarchy, and that France would forgive the traitors
who betrayed her&mdash;Marmont, Augereau, Talleyrand, and Lafayette&mdash;as he
forgave them. Louis he pardoned in the same spirit for the "libel
published in 1820; it is full of falsehoods and falsified documents."
The blame for Enghien's murder he took to himself. The second portion
of the document is a series of munificent-sounding bequests to a list
of legatees which includes every one who had done the testator any
important service since his earliest childhood. France under the
Bourbons confiscated the imperial domain of about a hundred and eighty
millions, which Napoleon had estimated at over two hundred and twenty.
When the nation passed again under the Bonapartes it appropriated
eight millions toward the unpaid legacies. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> the end his
executors collected three and a half millions of francs wherewith to
pay bequests amounting on their face to over nine and a half. In a
codicil he remembers a certain Cautillon, who had undergone trial for
an alleged attempt to assassinate Wellington. "Cautillon had as much
right to assassinate that oligarch as he [Wellington] to send me to
the rock of St. Helena to perish there." Such was the nature and
substance of an appeal to a generous, forgiving nation, and to
posterity, by one who wrote in the same document that he wished to die
in the bosom of the Christian church, whose central doctrine is love,
and whose ethic is forgiveness of enemies.</p>

<p>"I closed the abyss of anarchy and brought order out of chaos. I
cleansed the Revolution, ennobled the people, and made the kings
strong. I have awakened all ambitions, rewarded all merit, and
enlarged the borders of glory." These were the words of Napoleon in
1816; he Lived in this hallucination to the end. In the autumn of 1820
he realized his condition, and throughout the winter he was feeble and
depressed. In February, 1821, he began to fail rapidly, and the
symptoms of his disease, cancer in the stomach, multiplied; but, in
spite of feebleness, he faced death with courage. On May third two
English physicians, recently arrived, came in for consultation; they
could only recommend palliatives, and under the influence of that
treatment the imperial patient kept an uncertain hold on his
faculties. Two days later a violent storm of wind and rain set in. A
spreading willow, under which Napoleon had spent many hours, was
overturned; the trees planted by his hands were uprooted; and a
whirlwind devastated the garden in which he had worked for exercise.
The death of the sufferer was coincident, and scarcely less violent.
The last words uttered were caught by listening ears as the sun rose;
they were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> "Tête ... armée." Mme. Bertrand and her children
were present; at the sight of their friend's suffering the boy fainted
and the little girls broke into loud lamentation. At eleven in the
morning the supreme agonies began; a little before six in the evening
the heart put forth its last convulsive effort, and ceased to beat.
The mournful band of watchers within bowed their heads. Without the
door another watch was set&mdash;that of the orderly. During the first
outburst of grief among those at the bedside two officers entered
silently, felt the cold limbs, marked the absence of life, and left
without a word. England's prisoner had escaped.</p>

<p class="p2">It requires a complex environment to develop a man of any sort; for
the exhibition of his personality and identity he must live in family,
church, and state, and beyond all these surroundings even the meanest
of mankind is subject to some cosmopolitan influence. How much more
true is this of a historical and political personage, who is and can
be himself only under the conditions which permit the play of his
powers. Removed from these, his soul and spirit sicken, his character
becomes morbid, his capacities are crippled, his identity is
distorted. Nothing could be more fatuous and simple than the effort to
read the true character of Napoleon Bonaparte from his talk and
behavior when an exile; a prisoner of time and space, as world
communications then were; an exhausted body; a crippled, outraged
spirit, reduced for attack and defense to the weapons of the pen and
the tongue wielded on and over an immensity of apartness. Yet exactly
this has been the self-imposed task of many investigators and writers.
The literature of his prison-house has grown to vast dimensions, and
readers feel cheated when the bald outline of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> all that may
even be considered history is offered for their consideration. The
narrative of the St. Helena epoch in his life just given is probably
accurate, and there are portions of it that rest on historical
evidence both objective and internal, as trustworthy as most of what
passes for history.</p>

<p>But when this is said the statement must be carefully guarded, for the
reason that substantially all our evidence is virtually such as would
be given about himself by a convict behind the bars, his sympathizing
accomplices, his jailer, and his prosecutors. The simile is not
strained. The surgeon of the <i>Northumberland</i>, ignorant of French,
gathered from those of Napoleon's attendants who spoke English such
scraps regarding the prisoner as he could, published them, and lost
his government employment. The book was widely read and proved a very
lucrative enterprise. Outside its pages there was profound silence and
complete ignorance in Europe regarding the now mysterious convict,
buried to the world. Craving for information was universal and
insatiate; if only Napoleon himself would speak! It appeared as if the
longing were satisfied in a published "Manuscript arrived from St.
Helena by unknown means." The volume was difficult to procure,
although edition followed edition in swift succession; many a precious
copy was used in reading circles and there are still in existence a
considerable number of the very numerous reproductions made at the
time with pen and ink. One of these was actually sold not long ago to
an unsuspecting editor in the United States and published in his
magazine as a rarity. It fell flat because so many knew the truth:
that it was apocryphal, the merry jest of a Genevese gentleman, Lullin
de Châteauvieux, who lived to see his sport a dangerous element in
the falsification of history. It was not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> only Napoleonic in
style, but too Napoleonic; and, considered as an imperialist pamphlet,
an anti-royalist pronunciamento, brought into being the embryo of a
legend such as men crave and which the loyal efforts of many
historians have utterly failed to destroy. Its contents, of course,
are utterly worthless except as a comedy, a mask of literature which
influenced public opinion.</p>

<p>The first known opportunity of the Napoleon court for communication
with the outside world was afforded by the British government. The
guarding and maintenance of Napoleon proved a source of great
expenditure. The garrison and military staff, the hovering vessels of
the navy, the entertainment of the continental commissioners, and
especially the allowance for the establishment of Longwood, miserable
as it was&mdash;the total cost appeared to the London authorities
exorbitant. Prices of supplies at St. Helena were enormous because of
its remoteness. So the subordinates of the ministry, with the assent
of their superiors, determined upon reductions, and they began with
the household of the Emperor, issuing orders that four of its members
should be dismissed. These were, first, the Polish adventurer
Piontkowski, part gentleman, part domestic, and wholly emissary and
spy, who had been sent out by the English government in a vessel which
followed the <i>Northumberland</i>, for reasons best known to themselves.
He appears to have accepted a charge from Napoleon; that, namely, of
laying before the Czar a formal protest against the treaties which
made Napoleon the joint prisoner of the allies, entrusted to the
charge of Great Britain. The next to leave were Archambaud and
Rousseau, one a huntsman, one a chief butler; they were to visit
Joseph Bonaparte in the United States and give him the fullest
information. The fourth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> was the chamberlain Santini, a
Corsican, and, though a soldier, utterly illiterate. To him was
confided a protest for use either in London or in Italy, as the event
should determine. A copy was made in Chinese ink on white satin ribbon
for concealment about his person, but the chief reliance was, that
"verbally and literally" he was drilled in its repetition until he
could neither forget nor mistake in its recital. The faithful servants
reached Joseph's home in America, the Pole on arrival in England
styled himself Count and Colonel, became the hero of a social season
in London, and vanished from history as mysteriously as he entered it.
But Santini with Italian adroitness gained not only the presence of
Lord Holland but his attentive ear; his recital was translated into
English and published, the matter was brought before Parliament by
interpellation of the great Whig statesman and caused great excitement
throughout the world.</p>

<p>Napoleon's "Appeal to the English Nation," as printed from Santini's
copy, recited the stupidity of his jailer, the unhealthiness of the
climate, the expense and difficulty of living. His statements were not
merely confirmed, the conditions of life on St. Helena were
monstrously exaggerated by Montchenu, the French commissioner, in a
private letter which was published soon after the arrival of Santini
in London. This, too, was circulated all abroad. Public opinion was
further agitated. The allied dynasties were made to feel ashamed by
their subjects, and in Great Britain there was a fierce surge of
reprobation, the resonance of which has not yet died away. The exile
was chained to a horrid rock, in a climate Europeans could not endure,
his miserable existence in hovels overrun with vermin must be eked out
by loans from friends and the sale of his silver tableware, he was
put to needless shame by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> the stupid regulations of a stupid
government, stupidly enforced by a stupid governor, he was sick of
body and heart, very sick and might die. Whose was the responsibility
for this disgrace to civilization? Somewhat in this way men talked and
questioned; soon his faults were forgotten in the pitiful recital of
his woes; the legend was further advanced, once more the glory of
Napoleon's epoch became a powerful force in Europe.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth of March, 1818, there arrived in England a member of
the St. Helena court, whose name and fame bid fair to rival if not to
obliterate those of all his companions in exile, though most
undeservedly. This was General Gourgaud, styled Master of Ordinance.
He was thirty-five years old and had been a soldier for sixteen,
winning promotion for intelligence and intrepidity, securing
Napoleon's affection by personal charm and by services which once at
least, and probably twice, directly saved the Emperor's life, until at
last he was a baron, a general at Waterloo, and a companion in St.
Helena. This all seems passing strange because he was a high officer
of Louis XVIII before Napoleon's return from Elba; made obeisance to
established authority as soon as he returned from captivity, and
during the successive governments of France to his death in 1852 found
favor with each in turn. Whatever he was before and after, his life in
St. Helena was that of a sentimental, jealous, sensitive child,
scarcely a male at that. Every word and every act of every one gave
him such pangs of wounded vanity that at last his presence was
intolerable and by the influence of the Montholons it was arranged
that he should leave. No sooner was the dust of Longwood shaken from
his feet than within sight of its doors he accepted the kindly
attentions of his former jailers with eagerness, and no sooner were
those feet ashore in England than he began <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> to woo the
ministry, to make advances to the Bourbons, and to fawn on the Holy
Alliance itself. It was not until he experienced certain chills and
got his groping finger on the pulse of public opinion that he found
himself utterly mistaken and in danger of mortal error. He then wrote,
and gave to the public prints, a curious letter, addressed to Marie
Louise, asserting that Napoleon was dying in the torments of a
frightful agony. This amounted to a recantation. In consequence he was
banished from England under the Alien Bill. At once he hurried away to
Prince Eugène (Napoleon's treasurer) and from him reclaimed and
received, for four years certainly, his arrears of imperial pay and
pension. In 1822 he was permitted to return to France.</p>

<p>The notoriety of his name is due to two sets of circumstances. Sir
Walter Scott told the truth about his conduct, just when the noble
general was beginning to swim in the refulgence of the Napoleonic
legend. There ensued a wordy warfare. The weapons on one side were
official papers; on the other denials, insinuations, and finally the
assertion of some vague commission or another given by the great
captive, impossible of fulfilment in any way other than by the
mysterious course of the plenipotentiary. This mystery is still
unsolved and the commission undiscovered, but in France at least the
conflict still rages. As late as 1908 a caustic critic was challenged
to a duel by the testy and furious family head of the Gourgauds. The
other set of circumstances is equally curious. Gourgaud left behind
him a journal of his St. Helena life. Its contents are certainly
authentic evidence of the writer's character, and as there is no means
of checking the authenticity of what is recorded about Napoleon and
his Longwood household, the record may possibly be and probably is
accurate. The sore spirit of the writer required a confidant, and
since <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> there was no congenial soul to receive his outpourings
he relieved himself as other sentimental egoists have done in the
pages of a journal. From these the most conscientious efforts have
been made to construct a psychology of the Emperor. The result is a
morbid psychology of a caged falcon, the revival of bitter controversy
as to the treatment of the great prisoner by a Tory ministry, and
generally of a rather abstracted but intense interest in the
Napoleonic legend. Hence the prolonged vogue of a celebrity which
should have been ephemeral. The general is in no proper sense a
historical factor except as the influence of his behavior in Europe
served to quicken the existing lively interest in Napoleon. As far as
his earliest testimony went, and many inclined to heed it, the master
he had served was in excellent health, was kindly treated, and in
general was better off than could have been expected. This of course
lashed the imperialists to fury; their information was to the
diametrically opposite effect.</p>

<p>Antecedent to Gourgaud's departure was that of Las Cases, but his
journey was so impeded, his health so shaken, and his devotion so
discounted, that whatever he accomplished in molding public opinion
was logically subsequent to the work of the general. Spanish by
origin, French by six centuries of devotion, his family was of the
higher nobility. He himself had been an emigrant, but had returned to
become a member of the Council of State. As a great civil official he
had learned to love Napoleon and deliberately chose exile with him
rather than honors and service under the restored Bourbons. In 1816 he
wrote, and endeavored to forward secretly, letters containing his
views as to the disgraceful treatment of Napoleon. These were
intercepted and the writer was condemned in Lowe's first fury to
depart. On second thought the governor begged <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> him to remain
under certain restrictions; these Las Cases would not accept, possibly
because he saw himself of greater use in Europe than in St. Helena. He
reached the Cape of Good Hope in January, 1817, was there detained
eight months, was then forwarded to England, where he was forbidden to
land, thence to Belgium, and finally, in December, a physical
derelict, he found shelter in Frankfort-on-the-Main, where he lived
for a time under the strictest surveillance. His faculties were soon
restored to a certain rather impaired activity, and in 1818 he laid a
powerful protest against the treatment of Napoleon before the Congress
of Aix-la-Chapelle. No less a person than the Emperor's mother was his
agent and intermediary. A meeting of reactionary sovereigns and their
ministers, terrified by the throes of a revolutionary spirit more and
more personified in Bonaparte, could in no case be receptive to such a
remonstrance, and was utterly cold and scornful in the face of
Gourgaud's evidence to the well-being and kind treatment of Napoleon,
already published. Even with the most enlightened and liberal public
of Europe, that of Great Britain, Las Cases' controversial
publications fell rather flat. Readers were weary of the theme, since
O'Meara was now and had been for some time past in possession of the
Napoleonic field.</p>

<p>Dr. O'Meara, the Emperor's body-physician, was a warm-hearted
Irishman, faithful, able, and devoted. That he received substantial
gratuities from his patient is no longer questioned, and these
transfers of money have been called by a harsh name; yet it is easy
for a loyal but illogical devotee to confuse salary, gifts, fees,
bribes, each with each, and one with the other; the crime was not
quite so heinous with a man of his character as it would have been in
persons of severer quality and mold. It seems equally certain that
the stern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> pedant acting as governor would gladly have
employed the same inducements to secure him as a spy. At least he did
not qualify as the channel of a double espionage, and for that reason
fell under the grave suspicion of authority. The diagnosis of
Napoleon's malady as very grave, which he had made, was confirmed in
January, 1819, by Stokoe, the ship's surgeon of the <i>Conqueror</i>, the
British flag vessel then in the harbor. But from O'Meara it was not
accepted; he was dismissed from service and on July twenty-fifth,
1818, sailed homeward. On August seventeenth the London "Morning Post"
began to print communications sent from St. Helena by him, and shortly
after he landed, in October, there appeared a pamphlet by him
attacking Sir Hudson Lowe. His voluminous "Voice from St. Helena" was
not published until after Napoleon's death. Like the rest of the
contemporary memoirs and memorials, the value of his writings lies in
their effect on the liberal sentiment of the world. The Metternich
system of repression and intervention, which worked its will in
dynastic government for a generation after Napoleon, engendered a
newer liberalism which forgot the tyranny of Napoleonic imperialism
and remembered the Consulate as expressing a well-organized form of
government, adapted superbly for crushing systems, dynastic or
aristocratic or plutocratic, which oppressed mankind by denying the
only possible equality, equality of opportunity, the Napoleonic
"carrière ouverte aux talents." By all sympathetic nationalists,
constitutionalists, and radicals these books were literally devoured,
and in France particularly their effect was lasting. There could never
have been a second Napoleon except as he was thought likely to
reproduce the Consulate; when his rule had proved to be imperialistic
the country was disenchanted. Liberty with order is so ardently
desired! but too often the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> devices to secure it beget license
with chaos. The literal correctness of O'Meara's reporting, like that
of the rest, cannot be controverted by any rebutting testimony, but
the nature portrayed is the same morbid, sensational,
notoriety-seeking, unwholesome, and pathological specimen as that
furnished by the others.</p>

<p>Dr. Stokoe was speedily disgraced because it was now certain that any
bulletin of serious illness was evidence of conspiracy by the Emperor
and his friends for his escape. It is still affirmed that this second
physician yielded to the Emperor's blandishments and disobeyed Lowe's
orders. His successor, Dr. Verling, was Lowe's man, and, finding his
position intolerable, resigned with the insinuation that he could not
accept bribes. The party strife demanded either that Napoleon must be
entirely well and well treated, or else utterly moribund and
abominably used. Neither was the case, but a mortal disease had
declared itself, his grand marshal was seriously alarmed, and the
members of the Bonaparte family in Europe were dreaming of Napoleon's
escape or planning the renewal of his household by fresh blood. The
Bertrands and the Montholons, though faithful and devoted, were simply
worn out. A Corsican physician, Dr. Antommarchi, and an Italian
priest, Buonavita, were added to the household in September, 1819.
Mme. Montholon with her child was already at home seeking substitutes,
having departed from St. Helena in July. Neither event had any special
consequences. Mme. Montholon found a possible successor to the grand
marshal in the person of Planat, an officer of the Hundred Days.
Negotiations for his sailing were protracted; such was Napoleon's
condition before they were concluded that Montholon would not consider
deserting his post, though Bertrand was quite willing to see Planat
supplant himself. Buonavita was ill and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> returned to Europe.
Antommarchi was detested by his patient, a new priest and a new doctor
were found, and the faithful Pauline desired to join her exiled
brother. By this time the year 1820 had passed and the fateful spring
of 1821 was well advanced. All preparations for relieving the
household and the guard at St. Helena were now, of course, futile.
Three years of suffering had culminated in the death of the exile.</p>

<p>The documentary material for the St. Helena epoch is very scanty. The
"Mémorial" of Las Cases and the "Voice" of O'Meara are both valuable
as works but not as transcripts. Of Gourgaud's "Journal" the value is
greater, but the medium of transmission most abnormal. The volumes of
Mrs. Abell and Lady Malcolm furnish very slight material; the papers
of the outsiders like Montchenu, Balmain, and Sturmer, like even Lowe
himself, furnish side-lights only; the souvenirs of Mme. Montholon are
trifling and cannot bear critical examination. The recitals of
Montholon were thought of importance until careful scrutiny showed how
he had drawn on Las Cases and O'Meara, how scanty, scrappy, and
confused his own notes were, and finally, when his letters to his wife
were printed, how completely these unfalsified documents contradicted
the other publications in the few interesting points on which they
touch, both in the English edition of Colburn and the carefully edited
and reedited French edition. The more the slight authentic material is
examined the more certain it appears that it is hopeless to read from
it Napoleon's character, even in the unnatural environment of St.
Helena, least of all for the years of real life. Conduct is the only
test of belief, not the invalid lamentations or cynical banter of
dreary, hopeless imprisonment. And when all this talk of a man in
anguish is dubiously reported, distorted by the medium of a
heart-sick listener, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> or by the transcription of men bored to
extinction, its value is obviously still further diminished. The story
has been briefly narrated of how the legend was engendered, of how it
was planted and watered on the continent of Europe, and its influence
on subsequent generations has been indicated. This is the sum total of
what history finds as its material during the closing years of
Napoleon's life. The souvenirs of Bertrand and Marchand are as yet
inaccessible, if indeed they exist. Some day their possible
publication may shed a few rays of new light on minor points: they
cannot greatly enlarge or substantively reconstruct the slight
historical material we have been able to discover. For valuable
generalizations we must fall back on the many abundant facts of
Napoleon's long career, on the very few facts of his conduct when
mewed and exasperated at St. Helena, on the effects which these in sum
have produced in history. The world at large marvels at the general,
the statesman, the conqueror, the emperor; it is apt to pass unnoticed
the judge and tamer of two epochs, the mediator between a ruined past,
a chaotic present, and a future, orderly at least, though streaked
with the stains of tyranny.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Review</p>
<p>The tomb of Erasmus in Basel is marked by a stone slab on which are an
epitaph, an effigy, and then the pathetic word "Terminus." Should
these fateful syllables be written over the mortal remains of Napoleon
Bonaparte? No. Beyond his death there was more, far more than the work
he wrought during his life. Men ever love a seeming mystery, and while
they do, a favorite theme of speculation will be the career of the
great Corsican in its historical aspect. Before our long study can be
brought to a close, two questions must be considered, or rather two
sides of one question must be viewed. Why did he rise, and what did he
accomplish? The answers will be as various as the investigators who
give them. But the man as seen in the preceding pages certainly
displays these recognizable characteristics: he was a man of the
people, he had a transcendent military genius, he was indefatigable,
and he had unsurpassed energy.</p>

<p>No mere man, even the most remarkable, can climb without supports of
some kind, however unstable they may be. Napoleon Bonaparte did not
soar, he rose on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> the ladder of power by stages easily
traceable: first by the protection of the Robespierres; then by the
necessities and velleities of Barras and the Directory; afterward by
the encouragement of all France, which was sick of the inefficient
Directory; and still later by the army, which adored a leader who
frankly repaid devotion in the hard cash of booty, and bravery in the
splendid rewards of that glory which was a national passion. With such
opportunities, Bonaparte unfolded what was certainly his supereminent
quality&mdash;the quality which endeared him to the French masses as did no
other, the quality which above all others distinguished him from the
hated tyrants under whom they had so long suffered, the quality which
even the meanest intellect could mark as distinctively middle-class,
in opposition to its negation in the upper class&mdash;the quality, namely,
of untiring industry; laborious, self-initiated, self-guided,
self-improving industry. This burgher quality Napoleon possessed as no
burgher ever did. It was no exaggeration, but the simple truth, when
he said to Roederer: "I am always working. I think much. If I appear
always ready to meet every emergency, to confront every problem, it is
because, before undertaking any enterprise, I have long considered it,
and have thus foreseen what could possibly occur. It is no genius
which suddenly and secretly reveals to me what I have to say or do in
some circumstance unforeseen by others: it is my own meditation and
reflection. I am always working&mdash;when dining, when at the theater; I
waken at night in order to work." How profoundly this was impressed
upon those intimately associated with Napoleon can be traced in their
memoirs on many a page. It was Soult who said, most sapiently: "What
we call an inspiration is nothing but a calculation made with
rapidity."</p>

<p>Generally there is no mystery in the power of domination: <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> he
rules who is indispensable. The Jacobins needed a man, they found him
in the unscrupulous Bonaparte; the Directory needed a man, they found
him in the expert artillerist; France needed a man, she found him in
the conqueror of Italy. And having risen, he did not intermit his
industry for a moment. Rehearsing his coronation by means of puppets,
or studying with painful care the complicated accounts of his fiscal
officers, or absorbing himself in whatever else it might be, he was
always the man who knew more about everything than any one else.
Throughout his reign he was the fountainhead of every governmental
activity: the council of state sharpened not their own, but his
thoughts; his secretaries were his pocket note-book; his ministers
were the executors of his personal designs; pensions and presents were
given by him to his friends, and not to those who served the state as
they themselves thought best; every French community received his
personal attention, and every Frenchman who came to his general
receptions was treated with rude jocularity. In all this he was
perfectly natural. At times, however, he felt compelled to
attitudinize; perhaps, in the theatrical poses which he assumed for
self-protection or for the sake of representing a personified,
unapproachable imperial majesty, he copied Talma, with whom he
cultivated a sort of intimacy. Possibly, too, his violent sallies were
considered dramatic by himself. "Otherwise," he once said, "they would
have slapped me on the shoulder every day." "It is sad," remarked
Roederer, apropos of a certain event. "Yes, like greatness," was
Napoleon's rejoinder.</p>

<p>Napoleon's preëminence lasted just as long as this effective personal
supremacy continued. When his faculties refused to perform their
continuous, unceasing task, he began to decline; when the material of
his calculations transcended all human power, even his own, the
descent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> grew swifter; and the crash came when his abilities
worked either intermittently or not at all. Ruin was the consequence
of feebleness; the imagination of the world had clothed him with
demoniac qualities, but it ceased so to do just in proportion as his
superiority to others in plan and execution began to diminish. "There
is no empire not founded on the marvelous, and here the marvelous is
the truth." These were the words of Talleyrand, addressed to the First
Consul on June twenty-first, 1800, just after the news of Marengo had
reached Paris. The marvel of the absolute monarchy was the divine
right of kings: when men ceased to hold the doctrine, the days of
absolutism were numbered. The marvel of Napoleon was his unquestioned
human supremacy: when that declined his empire fell.</p>

<p>In the truest sense of that word so dear to modern times, Napoleon was
a self-made man. By his extraordinary energy he made a deficient
education do double duty; and those of his natural gifts which in a
sluggish man would have been mediocre, he paraded so often, and in
such swift succession, that they appeared miraculous. This fiery
energy, it cannot too often be repeated, was the man's most
distinctive characteristic; when it failed he was undone. Was
consistency, as generally understood, to be expected in this
personage; is it, indeed, found in most great men? Nowhere does the
theory of evolution writhe to sustain itself more than in psychology;
nowhere does it discover a greater complexity&mdash;a complexity which
makes doubtful its sufficiency. Admitting that Napoleon was selfish;
that he was lustful; that once, at least, he was criminal; that at
various times&mdash;yes, even frequently&mdash;he was unpopular, and dared not
in extremity call for a national uprising to sustain his cause; that
he had pitiful limitations in dealing with religion, politics, and
finance; supposing him to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> have displayed on occasion the
qualities of a resurrected medieval free-lance, or of the Borgias, or
of other historical monsters; confessing that he was launched upon the
fiery lake of revolution by the madness of extreme Jacobinism;
sustaining the awful indictment in each detail&mdash;was there no reverse
to the medal, no light to the shadow, no general result except
negations? Was the work of Alexander the Great worthless because of
his debaucheries? Was Catharine II of Russia a mere damned soul
because of her harlotries? Did Talleyrand's duplicity and meanness
render less valuable or permanent the work he did in thwarting the
coalition at Vienna? The answer of history is plain: what the great of
the earth have wrought for others or against them is to be recorded
and judged with impartiality; how they sinned against themselves is to
be told as an awful warning, and then to be left for the decision of
the Great Tribunal. Modern philosophy requires such complicated and
yet such minute knowledge in every department of science that the
specialist has supplanted the general scholar and the system-maker;
the man who aspires to create a plan displaying the unity of either
the objective or the subjective world, or any harmony of one with the
other, is generally regarded as either an antiquated imbecile or a
charlatan. Yet in the examination of historical characters a
symmetrical consistency capable of being grasped by the meanest
intellect is imperiously demanded by all readers and critics. This is
natural, but not altogether reasonable: symmetry cannot be found in
the commonest human being on our globe, much less in those who rise
supereminent. The greater the man, the more impossible to connect in a
mathematical diagram the different phases of his conduct. The search
for mediocre consistency in the character of Napoleon is like the
Cynic philosopher's quest for a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> This personage strove, and with considerable success, to
think and act for an entire nation&mdash;ay, more, for western Europe. In
order to render this conceivable, he first took command of his own
body&mdash;sleeping at will, and never more than six hours; eating when and
what he would, but always with extreme moderation; waking from
profound slumber and rousing his mind instantaneously to the highest
pitch, so that he then composed as incisively as in the midst of
active ratiocination. He was able to train his secretaries and
servants into instruments destitute of personal volition&mdash;even his
great generals, who were taught to act for themselves within certain
limits, never transcended the fixed boundary, and grew inefficient
when deprived of his impulse. He never failed to reward merit or to
gratify ambition for the sake of securing an able lieutenant, and
nascent devotion he quickened into passion by the display of suitable
familiarity. A thoughtful, self-contained, self-sufficient worker, he
was sometimes a trifle uneasy in social intercourse, perhaps always so
beneath his mask of good breeding, when he wore one; but he played his
various rôles in public with consummate skill, except that he made
nervous movements with his eyes, hands, and ears. His little tricks of
rolling his right shoulder, tugging at his cuffs, and the like; his
inability to write, and his generally clumsy movements when irritated,
were due to deficient training in early childhood. Forbidding in his
intercourse with ambitious women and other self-seekers, he was
considerate with the suffering, and found it difficult, if not
impossible, to refuse the petitions of the needy. Loving rough and
ready ways in those busied about his person,&mdash;as, for instance, when
his valet rubbed him down in the morning with a coarse towel,&mdash;he was
yet so sensitive that he had to have his hats worn by others before
he could set them on his own <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> head. It is useless to seek even
homely physical consistency in a man thus constituted.</p>

<p>It is equally useless to ask whether Napoleon could have been as great
a man in another epoch as he was in his own. In any epoch of warfare
he would have been great; it is likely that in any epoch of peace he
would have reached eminence as a legislator and administrator. The
real historical question is this: How did he, being what he was, and
his age, being what it was, interact one upon the other; and what was
the resultant? There was as little consistency in his age as in
himself; the sinuosities of each fitted strangely into those of the
other, and the result was a period of twenty years on which common
consent fixes the name of the Napoleonic age. Does his personality
throw any light on the antecedent period&mdash;does his career influence
the succeeding years?</p>

<p>The age of the Revolution has such intimate connection with the
movements of French society that it is very generally called in other
countries the French Revolution. But while the movement developed
itself more easily and took more radical forms in France than
elsewhere, it was due to the condition of civilization the world
around. France has been in a peculiar sense the teacher of Europe; for
in language, literature, laws, and institutions she is the heir of
Rome. In spite of Roman Catholicism, or perhaps in consequence of the
Roman hierarchy, her inheritance has been pagan rather than Christian;
her ethics have been Hellenic, her literature Augustan, her laws
imperial, her temperament a combination of the Stoic and Epicurean
which is essentially Latin, her language elegant, elliptical, and
precise like that of Livy or Tacitus. The Teuton in general, the
Anglo-Saxon in particular, may give his days and nights to classical
studies: he is never so imbued with their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> spirit as the Gaul.
"It is with his Bible in one pocket and his Shakspere in another,"
said an eminent Frenchman not long since, "that the Anglo-Saxon goes
forth to reduce the world in the interests of his commerce, his
civilization, and his religion. The most enlightened has neither the
cold worldliness of Horace nor the calculating zeal of Cæsar, but he
has the persistency of faith in himself and his nation which, whatever
may be his personal belief, is a constituent element in his blood, or,
better still, the controlling member of that complex organism to which
he belongs." I venture to believe, on the other hand, that the
Frenchman espouses his cause from an unselfish impulse begotten of
pure reason, an ethereal ichor percolating through society by channels
of sympathy, which diminishes the historic pressure for continuous
national consistency and natural unity, but emphasizes the great
uplifting movements of society. The French armies of the Revolution
went forth to scour Europe for its deliverance from feudalism,
absolutism, and ecclesiasticism, because the French people had renewed
their youthful and pristine vigor in their enthusiasm for pure
principle without regard to experience or expediency. Napoleon
Bonaparte had all their doctrine, with something more: a consuming
ardor unconscious of any physical limitations to the nervous strength
of himself or others, and a readiness for any fate which would
transmute his dull, unsuccessful, commonplace existence into
excitement. When he found his opportunity to heap Pelion upon Ossa, to
supplement himself by the splendors of French devotion, he did indeed
come near to transcending even the Olympians and storming the seat of
Kronos.</p>

<p>It was a long, discouraging, heartbreaking struggle by which he gained
his first vantage-ground. This was no exceptional experience; for
every adventurer knows <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> that it is more troublesome to make
the start than to continue the advance. It is harder to save the first
small capital than to conduct a prosperous business. It is more
difficult, apparently, in human life to overcome the inertia of
immobility than that of motion; at least psychological laws seem in
this respect to contravene those of physics. It is not true that the
armies of the Republic were those of the Bourbons: the transition may
have been gradual, but it was radical. It is also untrue that the
armies of Napoleon were those of the Revolution: they differed as the
zenith from the nadir, being recruited on a new principle, animated by
new motives, and led by an entirely different class of men. A supreme
command having been attained by means curiously compounded of
chivalric romance and base scheming, the man of action did not
hesitate a moment to put every power in motion. Throwing off all
superior control, he set himself to every task in the revolution of
Italy&mdash;conquest, political and religious; constructive politics and
administration; social and financial transformation. Winning the
devotion of his troops by intoxicating successes, as a leveler he was
permanently successful; but this typical burgher had no permanent
success in building up a democratic-imperial society out of the royal,
princely, and aristocratic elements which had so long monopolized the
ability of the peninsula; what he wrought outlasted his time, but the
country had to undergo another revolution before its middle classes
were ready for the heavy burden of independence and self-government.
Yet the struggle for what was accomplished appears to have created a
climacteric in the doer. Before the days of Italy his ambitions were
petty enough: employment in the service of Russia or England,
supremacy in Corsica or military promotion in France; but afterward
they enlarged by leaps and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> bounds: Italian principalities,
Austrian dukedoms, Lombard confederations, the primacy of France in
some form, Oriental dominion&mdash;one such concept took form in the
morning, to be swept away at night and replaced by ever more luxurious
growths of fantasy. The realization of these dreams was still more
amazing than their misty formation. The Revolutionary doctrines of the
passing age had stimulated France to over-exertion; her leaders were
discredited, her people exhausted. The same agitation had stupefied
the Italians; but whatever their political disintegration may have
been, the Roman chair and throne retained its moral influence as the
bond and mainspring of society throughout the whole peninsula; and now
the successor of St. Peter was humbled to the dust, willing to escape
with the mere semblance of either secular or ecclesiastical
independence. It was an exceptional moment, a vacillating,
retrogressive hour in the history of Austria, of France, and of Italy.
The exceptional man, the vigorous citizen of a new political epoch,
the inspired strategist of a new military epoch, the unscrupulous
doubter of a new religious epoch&mdash;this typical personage was at hand
to take advantage of the situation; and he did so, hastening the
disintegrating processes already at work, seizing every advantage
revealed by the crumbling of old systems, and reaping the harvest of
French heedlessness. The opportunity gave the man his chance, but the
chance once seized, the man enlarged his sphere with each successive
year.</p>

<p>This he did by means which were as remarkable as the personage who
devised them&mdash;and remarkable, too, not for their negative, but for
their constructive quality. Broadly stated, the Revolution utterly
expunged all the governmental and social guarantees of the preceding
monarchy, destroying not merely the absolute power <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> of one
man with its sanction of divine right, but all the checks upon it to
be found either in the ancient traditions of the people or in their
ancient institution of parliaments. It will be clear to the careful
student of the Revolutionary governments that while there was a
gradual clarifying of opinion antecedent to the Consulate, and a vague
longing for guarantees of individual rights higher than the acts of
any assembly, however representative it claimed to be, nevertheless
great ideas, great conceptions, great outlines, had all remained in
their inchoate state, and that of the several succeeding constitutions
each had been more worthless than the one before. Almost any kind of a
constitution will serve an enlightened nation which has confirmed
political habits, if it chooses to support a fundamental law not
hostile to them; and none, however ingenious, can stand before
recalcitrant populations. The Revolutionary constitutions of France,
excepting perhaps that of 1791, were alike feeble; and in the stress
applied to the one democratic land of Europe by her dynastic enemies
all around, they were not worth the paper and ink used to record them.
Under each had developed a pure despotism of one kind or another, on
the plea that in war there must be a single head, either an executive
committee or an executive man. These persons or person had, on pleas
of necessity or expediency, gradually arrogated to the executive all
the powers of government, befooling the people more or less completely
by the specious formalities of various kinds through which the popular
will was supposed to find expression. No one understood this fact
better than Napoleon Bonaparte; and since it seemed that the supreme
power had to be in the hands of some one man or clique, he was easily
tempted to grasp it for himself when it became clear that the
profligate and dishonest Directory had run its course. He did not
make <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> the situation, but he used it. History does not record
that the French nation was shocked or discouraged by the events of the
eighteenth of Brumaire; on the contrary, the occurrences in Paris and
at St. Cloud seemed commonplace to a storm-tossed people, and the
results were welcomed by the majority in every class.</p>

<p>The reasons for this general satisfaction varied, of course; for the
conservative and progressive royalists, the conservative and radical
republicans of every stripe, had widely different expectations as to
the next act in the drama. But the chief actor was concerned only for
himself and the nation; partizans he neither honored nor feared,
except as he was anxious not to be identified with them. To him, as a
man of the people, it seemed that in the Revolution the third estate
had asserted itself; that the third estate must be pacified; that the
third estate must be prosperous; that the third estate, for all these
purposes, needed only to be confirmed in their simple theory of
government, which was that the power could be delegated by them to any
one fit to wield it, and this once done, the delegate might without
harm to the state be left undisturbed to manage the public business,
while the people should give their undivided attention to their
private affairs. How successful the Consulate was in this respect is
universally known and admitted. With consummate cleverness the First
Consul summoned to his assistance all the giants of his time, whether
they were scholars with their theories and knowledge, administrators
with their tact and experience, political managers with their easy
consciences and oiled feathers, or skilful demagogues with their
greedy followers and insatiate self-interest. These he either enticed
or bullied into his service, according as he read their characters; a
few&mdash;a very few&mdash;like Barère, he found obdurate, and drove into
provincial exile. At no <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> time did he make a finer display of
his astounding capacity for molding strong men by his still stronger
will than during the early days of the Consulate; and the manifest
reason for his success was that he had a fine instinct for character
and for putting the right man in the right place.</p>

<p>What he thus accomplished has been told. The foundations he then laid
rest solid to-day; the now antiquated edifice he erected on them,
though altered and repaired, still retains its identity. The
Revolution had overthrown the old régime completely, and the ruins of
society were without form and void. From this chaos Napoleon painfully
gathered the substantial materials of a new structure, and out of
these reconstructed the family, the state, and the church. He revived
the domestic spirit, made marriage a solid institution, and
reëstablished parental authority while destroying parental despotism.
In civil society he restored the right of property and fixed the
sanctity of contract, thus assuring respect for the individual and the
ascendancy of the law. The finances he reformed by an equitable system
of taxation, and by the establishment of an ingenious treasury system
comparable to that devised by Alexander Hamilton for the United
States. In the Concordat he went as far, probably, as France could
then go in emancipating religion and the church; Protestantism has
prospered under the regulations he laid down, and by his treatment of
the Jews they have been changed from despised and down-trodden social
freebooters into prosperous and patriotic citizens. Upon every class
of men then living he imposed by an iron will a system of his own. The
leading survivors of Jacobinism, extreme royalists, moderate
republicans, proscribers and proscribed, men of the bourgeoisie&mdash;all
bowed to his sway and accepted his rewards. It is said that they
yielded to the superior <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> force of his police and his
pretorians. Be it so. The fivefold police system he established was a
system of checks and counter-checks within itself, within the
administration, and even within the army&mdash;a body without which, as he
firmly believed, the beginnings of social transformation could not be
made. He professed, and no doubt honestly, that he would divest
himself of this police service as opportunity served, and deluded both
himself and his followers into the belief that the process was almost
complete before the close of his era. Through the perspective of a
century we can see the faults of Napoleon's plan. The Gallic Church is
still Roman, in spite of his intention that the Roman Church should
become French; the extreme centralization of his administrative system
still throttles local free government and makes both oligarchic rule
and political revolution easier in France than in any other free land;
the educational scheme which he formed, although more fully changed
than any other of his institutions, and but recently embarked, let us
hope, on a course for ultimate independence, nevertheless suffers in
its present complete dependence on state support, and in the
consequent absence of private personal enthusiasm which might make its
separate universities and schools rich in opportunities and strong in
the loyalty of their sons. But we must remember that the Consulate was
a hundred years since, and that for its day it wrought so beneficently
that Bonaparte, First Consul, remains one of the foremost among all
lawgivers and statesmen. And that, too, precisely for the reasons
which some cite as condemning him. He took the revolutionary ideas of
political, civil, and religious emancipation: with these he commingled
both his own sound sense and the experience of advisers from every
class, realizing as much of civil liberty and good order as appears
to have been practical at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> But in one respect he failed miserably, and that failure
vitiated much of the substantial gain which seemed to have been made.
He failed in curbing his own ambition. The majestic ridge of his
achievement was the verge of the precipice over which he fell. In the
first place, his signal success as a lawgiver was due entirely to the
dazzling splendors of his victories. Marengo was the climax to a
series of such achievements as had not so far been wrought on the
tented field within the bounds of French history. It is easy to assert
that the French were intoxicated because they were French: there is
not the slightest reason to suppose that any other nation under
similar circumstances would have behaved differently. The Seven Years'
War turned the heads of the English people completely, and they lost
their American colonies in consequence; Rome lost her political
liberty when she became mistress not only of the Latin, but of the
Greek and Oriental shores of the Mediterranean; the distant military
expeditions of Alexander the Great prepared the fall of his
ill-assorted empire. In each case the careful student will admit that
social exaltation was the forerunner of division and of subsequent
despotism in some form. Even in the little states of Greece and
southern Italy the tyrants always arose from the disintegration of
legal government, and by the assertion of some form of power&mdash;mind,
money, or military force.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, as a military despot that the First Consul
promulgated beneficent codes, founded an enduring jurisprudence,
created an efficient magistracy, and established social order. In this
process he completed the work of the Revolution by exalting the third
estate to ascendancy in the nation. The whole work, therefore, was not
only recognized as his in the house of every French burgher: he was
considered at every fireside to be the consummator of the Revolution
for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> which France had so long suffered in an agony of bloody
sweat. Was it therefore any wonder that not only he himself, but even
the most enlightened leaders of European thought, considered the
safety and renovation of European society to depend upon the extension
of his work? It is hard for us to appreciate this, because in France
Napoleon's institutions have remained almost as he left them, and
well-nigh stationary, while for a century the processes of ruthless
reform have been continuously working in other European lands, and
some neighboring peoples have outstripped the French in the matter of
a national unity consistent with local freedom. The First Consul felt
that in order to become great he had been forced to become strong; we
can understand that he could easily deceive himself into concluding
that in order to be greater he must become stronger. It was in these
days that he exclaimed, in the intimacy of familiar intercourse: "I
feel the infinite in me." Thereafter democracy in any form, even the
mildest, was offensive. Such men as Roederer were sent to Naples,
Berg&mdash;anywhere out of France. The times were not far removed from
those of the beneficent despots, except that this one ruled, not by
hereditary divine right, but by military force. Bonaparte's imperfect
training in politics and history made it possible for such visions as
those which now arose to haunt his brain. The beneficence he had
displayed already; for despotism he had had the finest conceivable
training, first among the sluggish populations of the Italian states
which he had reorganized, then in the myth of Egyptian conquest which
he had created and felt bound to maintain, and lastly in the national
disorders of a France shuddering at the possibility of a return either
to the hideous excesses of the Terror or to the intolerable abuses of
ecclesiasticism and absolute monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> Among other dreadful curses incident to revolution and civil
war is the stimulation of fanaticism. In his seizure of the supreme
power the purpose of the First Consul was justified to himself, and
his procedure was rendered tolerable to the nation at large by the
scandalous intrigues and complots which were hatched like cockatrices'
eggs in every foul cranny of the land. The conspirators stopped at
nothing: bad faith, subornation, murder of every variety, from the
dagger to the bowl. This gave the First Consul his chance to become
himself the arch-intriguer, and as such he overmatched all his
opponents, ultramontanes, radicals, and royalists. Finally only a few
unreconstructed reactionaries were left from each of these classes,
who, though exhausted and panting, still had the strength to be noisy,
and occasionally to make a feint of activity. But in the various
localities and classes of France each of the factions had numerous
silent and inactive sympathizers who had surrendered only as they felt
unable to keep up the uneven conflict. The flames of the volcano were
quenched, and the gulf of the crater was bridged by a crust, but the
lava of sedition boiled and seethed below. It is a well-known nostrum
for civil dissension to stir up foreign conflict, and then to call
upon the patriotism of men from all parties. To this the First Consul
dared not openly resort. In fact, the indications are that if his
enemies in France and his foes abroad had consented peaceably to the
fulfilment of his now manifest ambitions, he would himself have been
glad enough to secure without further fighting what he had gained by
war, and to extend the influence of a Bonapartist France by steady
encroachments rather than by exhausting hostilities. The word of every
man has exactly the value which his character gives it, and treaties
are worth the good faith of those who make them, not a tittle more.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> Neither of the parties to the general peace was exhausted,
neither was really earnest. It was a bellicose age: war was then in
the air, as peace is now. The rupture of the treaty made at Amiens was
quite as much the work of George III as it was of Bonaparte the First
Consul, and the two nations over which they ruled were easily led to
renew the struggle. Nothing goes to prove that there was long
premeditation on the part of either; but at the time and since, were
it not for the widespread distrust in Bonaparte's character, popular
opinion would have put the blame of renewed war more upon his opponent
than on him. Thus far the angel and the devil which struggle for
possession of every man had waged a fairly even conflict, and the
blame and praise of what is stigmatized as Bonaparte's conduct must be
meted out to his foes in even measure. He and his times had interacted
one upon the other to a remarkably even degree. But once launched on
the career of personal aggrandizement, every hindrance to consuming
ambition was ruthlessly cast aside. Until 1812 the responsibility for
inordinate bloodshed is all his own.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon the period of the Empire in order to
study Napoleon's character. It shines forth effulgent, but noxious. He
remained personally what he had always been&mdash;imperious, laborious,
unprincipled; but, on the other hand, kindly, generous, sensitive to
the popular movements. His thirst for power became predominant; his
lavish contempt for men and money displayed the recklessness of a
desperate parvenu; his passion for war burst all its bounds. Personal
ambition eclipsed principle, expediency, shrewdness&mdash;in short, every
quality which makes for self-preservation. The reason was not
conscious despair, but unconscious desperation. Politically he had
fought and won an easy but a decisive battle. Imperialism was firmly
seated. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> The behavior of the French people was natural enough,
but they lent themselves to his purposes with complete surrender. In
this the world learned a lesson which should never be forgotten: that
democracy is an excellent workhorse, but a poor charger; a good hack,
but an untrustworthy racer. The interest of the plain man is in his
daily life, his family, his business, his advancement. He cannot be an
expert in foreign or domestic politics, in public law, or in warfare;
expertness requires the exclusive devotion of a lifetime. Make the
common person a theorist, and he is an ardent democrat, but a poor
administrator. Hence the necessity in transition epochs for a wise
constitution. It was not difficult to convince the French burgher
that, all other forms of democratic administration having had a chance
and having failed in times of war, the only one so far untried&mdash;that
of delegating power to a single superior man&mdash;should have a fair
trial, the more as the excellent man was at hand. Even in times of
peace the hard-worked citizen either neglects his political duties
altogether, or, performing them in a thoughtless routine, longs for
some one he can trust to do his thinking and acting: in war, as far as
we have had the opportunity to observe in ancient and modern times,
his imperialism is avowed, and he demands a dictator. We have no
reason to suppose that there is any democracy which could outlast
twenty years of a herculean struggle for national life or death, and
such the Franco-English wars which introduced the last century seemed
to the Frenchman of that time to be.</p>

<p>From the soldier's point of view, Napoleon had likewise such an easy
triumph as has fallen to the lot of few commanders. His opponents were
so conservative that their ideas were antiquated, his own strategy was
so new and revolutionary that it dumfounded them. A favorite method
of detraction is illustrated by the familiar story <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> of
Columbus's egg. What is once done, anybody can do. The strategic
reputation of Frederick the Great is in our day first attacked by the
so-called comparative method&mdash;that is, by comparing it with the
achievements and system, not of his contemporaries, but of Napoleon,
his successor; and then the strategic reputation of Napoleon is
diminished by sneering at that of Frederick, with whose antiquated
method the new one came into comparison and contact, to the complete
disaster of the former. This vicious circle may be dismissed with
contempt. Napoleon's strategic genius was, unlike any other talent he
possessed, constructive and original. No doubt he studied Cæsar; no
doubt he studied Maillebois; no doubt he studied the work of Turenne
and of the great Frederick; no doubt he was a pupil of the giant
soldiers who inaugurated and carried on the wars of the Revolution;
but while others had pursued the same studies, it remained for him to
devise and put into operation a strategy based upon past experience,
but subversive of accepted dogmas, new, adapted to its ends, and
founded on theories which, though modified in practice by the
discoveries of an intervening century, have, when properly understood,
never, not even to-day, been shaken in principle. His triumphs as a
soldier, therefore, are his own; and it was not until all Europe had
learned the lessons which he taught her generals by a series of object
demonstrations lasting twenty years, that the teacher began to
diminish in success and splendor. The persistent critics of Frederick
have been asking and reiterating questions such as these: Why did not
the king begin early in July, 1756? Why did he not storm the camp of
Pirna? Why did he not continue the war in October? Why did he not
renew hostilities the following year until forced to it? And so on,
and so on. By this method they have shrunk the horizon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> to
their own dimensions, and have imprisoned their victim within the pale
of his faults; but a wider view and the historic background display
his strategy in large outline, as illuminated by the light of his age;
and thus the defeats of Kolin and Kunersdorf, as well as the victories
of Leuthen, Rossbach, Zorndorf, and Torgau, exhibit the Prussian
general as the great genius which he was. It was not until Napoleon
had taught his rivals what fighting ought to be that men could also
pick and nag at him by asking why Waterloo did not begin four hours
earlier, why more explicit directions were not given to Grouchy, why
in 1814 the desperate man chose to cut off the line of his enemies'
communications rather than withdraw into Paris and call the nation to
arms; and so on to infinity. Judged either historically or
theoretically, the strategy of Napoleon is original, unique, and
unexcelled. It is his greatest achievement, because his most
creative.</p>

<h4>Napoleon and the United States</h4>

<p class="summary">A Decisive Epoch &mdash; Britain Dominates the Sea &mdash; Napoleon's
     Policy &mdash; Trade and Western Empire &mdash; To the West Indies &mdash; Needs

     and West &mdash; The Louisiana Purchase and the Nation.</p>

<p>A decisive epoch was that of the eighteenth-century revolutions, a
crisis reached after long, slow preparation, precipitated by social
and religious bigotry, dizzy in its consummation, wild and headlong in
its flight, precipitous in its crash. Of this important time the
results have been so permanent that they are the commonplaces of
contemporary history; in what Carlyle called the revolutionary loom
the warp and woof were spun from the past, and the fabric is that from
which our working-clothes are cut. Within those years appeared the
great dominating soul of modern humanity, who displayed first and last
every weakness and every sordid meanness of mankind, but in such giant
dimensions that even his depravity inspires awe. His virtues were
equally portentous because they worked on the grand scale, with
materials that had been threshed and winnowed in the theory and
experience of five generations of mankind. It was well within this
stupendous age and by the act of this representative <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> man
that Louisiana was redeemed from Spanish misrule and incorporated with
the territories of the United States. Nor was this all. A careful
examination of the general political situation at that time will
exhibit the elemental and almost ultimate fact that the sale of
Louisiana was coincident with the turn of the age.</p>

<p>The substance of the treaty of Amiens was that Great Britain
ostensibly abandoned all concern with the continent of Europe, and
that France, ostensibly too, should strictly mind her own affairs in
her colonies and the remoter quarters of the globe. George III removed
from his escutcheon the fleur-de-lis, and from his ceremonial title
the style of king of France. Events narrated in another connection
proved the whole negotiation to have been on both sides purely
diplomatic, an exchange of public and hollow courtesies in order to
gain time for the realities in the struggle for supremacy between the
world powers of the period, a struggle begun with modern history,
renewed in 1688, and destined to last until the exhaustion of one of
the contestants in 1815. Neither party to the treaty had the slightest
intention of observing either its spirit or its letter. While the
paper was in process of negotiation Bonaparte was consolidating French
empire on the Continent, and after its signature he did not pause for
a single instant to show even a formal respect for his obligations.
The reorganization of Holland in preparation for its incorporation
into the French system, the annexation of Piedmont and the defiance to
Russia in the matter of her Italian protégés, the Act of Moderation in
Switzerland, and finally, the contemptuous rearrangement of Germany,
were successive steps which reduced England to despair for her
continental trade. To her it seemed as if there could be no question
about two things: first, that the old order must be restored, in
order to safeguard her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> commerce; and second, that her
colonial policy must be more aggressive than ever.</p>

<p>It was Samuel Adams who first sneered at his fatherland as a people of
shopkeepers. The winged word soon became a commonplace to all
outsiders, but as it flew every nation that used the gibe girded
itself to enter the struggle for the same goal. France above all was
determined to be a nation of shopkeepers, and the First Consul of what
was still a shaky experiment in government knew well that rather than
abandon that ambition, he must sacrifice every other. After all, a
colonial empire has value only as the home nation has accessible
ports, manufactories for colonial products, and wares to exchange with
the producers. France had neither factories nor manufactures, and was
destitute of nearly the whole machinery of exchange. Her merchant
vessels sailed only by grace of the British fleet. Her home market was
dependent on British traders even in times of war. Bonaparte's
foremost thought, therefore, was for concentration of energy. The
sea-power of the world was Britain's, and her tyranny of the seas
without a real check; even the United States could only spit out
defiant and revengeful threats when her merchantmen were treated with
contempt on the high seas by British men-of-war. Therefore with swift
and comprehensive grasp he framed and announced a new policy. The
French envoy in London was informed that France was now forced to the
conquest of Europe&mdash;this of course for the stimulating of French
industries&mdash;and to the restoration of her Occidental empire. This was
most adroit. The embers of French patriotism could be fanned into a
white heat by these well-worn but never exhausted expedients&mdash;a blast
against perfidious Albion and a sentimental passion for the New France
beyond the Atlantic. The motions were a feint against England by the
formation of a second <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> camp at Boulogne, where a force really
destined for Austria was assembled, and the wresting of Louisiana from
the weak Spanish hands which held it. As an incident of the agitation
it seemed best that the French democracy should have an imperial
rather than a republican title, and the style of emperor and empire
was exhumed from the garbage heap of the Terror for use in the
pageantry of a court.</p>

<p>In Europe thus, as in the neighboring continents, the rearrangement of
politics, territorial boundaries, social, economic, and diplomatic
relations, a change which has made possible the modern system, was
really dependent on the events which led to the adoption of the policy
just described. But this policy involved a reversal of every sound
historical principle in Bonaparte's plans. For twelve years longer he
was to commit blunder upon blunder; to trample on national pride; to
elevate a false system of political economy into a fetish; to conduct,
as in the Moscow campaign, great migrations to the eastward in
defiance of nature's laws; to launch his plain, not to say vulgar and
weak, family on an enterprise of monarchical alliances for which they
had no capacity; to undo, in short, as far as in him lay, every
beneficent and well-conceived piece of statesmanship with which he had
so far been concerned. It has been well said that had he died in
midsummer, 1802, his glory would have been immaculate and there would
have been no spots on his sun. The Napoleonic work in Europe was
destined to have its far-reaching and permanent results, but the man
was ere long almost entirely eliminated from control over them. The
very last of his great constructions was the sale of Louisiana. He
needed the purchase-money, he selected his purchaser and forced it on
him, with a view to upbuilding a giant rival to the gigantic power of
Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> When we turn therefore to America, we shall at once observe
on how slender a thread a great event may depend, how great a fire may
be kindled by a spark adroitly placed. While yet other matters were
hanging in the balance, he selected his own brother-in-law, General
Leclerc, such was his deep concern, to conduct an expedition to the
West Indies. There were embarked 35,000 men, and these the very flower
of the republican armies, superb fighters, but a possible thorn in the
side of a budding emperor at home. Their goal was San Domingo, where a
wonderful negro, Toussaint Louverture, noting the attractive example
of the benevolent despots in Europe, had, under republican forms, not
only abolished slavery, but had made himself a beneficent dictator.
The fine but delicate structure of his negro state was easily crushed
to the earth, but the fighting was fierce and prolonged, the climate
and the pest were enabled to inaugurate and complete a work of
slaughter more baleful than that of war, and two-thirds of the French
invaders, including the commander and fifteen of his generals, fell
victims to the yellow fever. The French were utterly routed, the sorry
remnant sailed away, and the blacks fell into the hands of the
worthless tyrant Dessalines, whose misrule killed the germs of order
planted by Toussaint. One of our historians thinks this check of
France by black soldiers to have been a determinative factor in
American history, for thereafter there could be no question of a Gulf
and Caribbean empire for France. Louisiana, he indicates, became at
once a superfluous dependency, costly and annoying. This is a
far-fetched contention: great as have been the services of the negro
to the United States since he first fought on the battle-field of
Monmouth under Washington, the failure of France in San Domingo was
not through the sword of the blacks, but was an act of God through
pestilence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> The circumstances that forced Louisiana upon the United
States, then a petty power with revenues and expenditures less than
those of many among the single states which now compose the
federation, arose from Napoleon's European necessities. The cession
from Spain included all that Spain had received from France, the whole
Gulf coast from St. Mary's to the Rio Grande, and the French
pretensions not only northwestward to the Rockies but even to the
Pacific. The return made to Spain was the insignificant kingdom of
Etruria and a solemn pledge that, should the First Consul fail in his
promise, Louisiana in its fullest extent was to be restored to Spain.
France therefore might not otherwise alienate it to any power
whatever. The exacting and suspicious spirit shown both by Charles IV
and his contemptible minister Godoy, Prince of the Peace, had
exasperated Bonaparte beyond endurance. The Spanish Bourbons were
doomed by him to the fate of their kinsfolk in France; a pledge to a
vanishing phantom of royalty was of small account. It was during the
delay created by the punctilio of Godoy that the failure of the San
Domingo expedition extinguished all hope of making Louisiana the sole
entrepôt and staple of supplies for the West Indies. And
simultaneously it grew evident that the truce negotiated at Amiens as
a treaty could not last much longer, that either France must endure
the humiliation of seeing her profits therefrom utterly withheld, or
herself declare war, or goad Great Britain into a renewal of
hostilities. This last, as is well known, was the alternative chosen
by Napoleon.</p>

<p>Our government had been in despair. The establishment of French empire
in the West Indies would have destroyed our lucrative trade with the
islands. It was trying enough that a feeble power like Spain should
command the outlet of the Mississippi basin, but intolerable that
such a mastery of the continent should fall <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> into the hands of
a strong and magisterial power like France. We were in dismay, even
after the departure of the French from San Domingo. Bonaparte,
however, was scarcely less disturbed; for Jefferson, despite his
avowed Gallicism, spiritedly declared both to the First Consul and to
Livingston, our minister to Paris, that the occupation of Louisiana by
the great French force organized to that end could only result in an
alliance of the two English-speaking nations which would utterly
banish the French flag from the high seas. Bonaparte preserved an
outward calm for those about him and went his way apparently
unperturbed. But inwardly his mind seethed, and without long delay he
took his choice between the courses open to him. It was the first
exhibition to himself and his family of the imperial despot soon to be
known as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. If Britain was the tyrant
of the seas, he would be despot of the land. To French empire he would
reduce Germany, Italy, and Spain in subjection, and with all the
maritime resources of the Continent at his back he would first shut
every important port to English commerce, and then with allied and
dependent fleets at his disposal try conclusions with the British
Behemoth for liberty of the seas and a new colonial empire. By the
second camp at Boulogne and the occupation of Hanover, Napoleon threw
England into panic, while simultaneously he began the creation of his
grand imperial army and thereby menaced Austria, the greatest German
power, in her coalition with Russia, Sweden, Naples, and Great
Britain. The latter, he was well aware, could face a hostile
demonstration on her front with courage, if not with equanimity; and
he determined to add a double stroke&mdash;to gain a harvest of gold and on
her rear to strengthen her exasperated transatlantic sea rival by
selling Louisiana to the United States.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> That determination was the turning-point in his career, just
as the sudden wheel and about-face of the splendid force at Boulogne,
when he hurled it across Europe at Vienna, displayed at last the
turning-point in his policy. His brother Lucien had been an
influential negotiator with Spain and plumed himself on the
acquisition of the great domain which had been for long the brightest
jewel in the crown of France. His brother Joseph had negotiated the
treaty of Amiens as a step preparatory to regaining a magnificent
colonial empire for his country, an empire of which an old and
splendid French possession was to be the corner-stone. Both were
stunned and then infuriated when they learned their brother's
resolution, sensations which were intensified to fury when they heard
him announce that he would work his will in spite of all
constitutional checks and balances. There is no historic scene more
grotesque than that depicted by Lucien in his memoirs when he and
Joseph undertook to oppose Napoleon. The latter was luxuriating in his
morning bath on April seventh, 1803, in the Tuileries when the
brothers were admitted. After a long and intimate talk on general
politics the fateful subject was finally broached by Napoleon, as he
turned from side to side and wallowed in the perfumed water. Neither
of the brothers could control his feelings, and the controversy grew
hot and furious from minute to minute until Joseph, leaning over the
tub, roared threats of opposition and words of denunciation. Brother
Napoleon, lifting himself half-way to the top, suddenly fell back and
clenched his arguments by splashing a full flood in the face and over
the body of Joseph, drenching him to the skin. A valet was summoned,
entered, and, paralyzed by the fury of the scene, fell in a dead
faint. New aid was called and, the fires of passion being quenched for
the time, the conflict ended until Napoleon and Joseph were decently
clothed, when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> it was renewed in the office of the secretary
Bourrienne. Ere long hot words were again spoken, violent language was
succeeded by violent gestures, until at last Napoleon in a theatrical
rage dashed his snuff-box on the floor, and the contestants separated.
Disjointed and fierce as was the stormy argument, it revealed the
whole of the imperial policy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile events in America, if not so picturesque and majestic, were
equally tempestuous. The peace policy of Jefferson was rapidly going
to pieces in the face of a westward menace, the Federalists were
jubilant, and in the Senate James Ross, of Pennsylvania, called for
war. When the intendant of Spain at New Orleans denied Americans the
storage rights they had enjoyed in that city since 1795, the French
politics of the President fell into general disrepute and contempt,
for men reasoned <i>a fortiori</i>, if such things be done in the green
tree, what shall be done in the dry? It mattered not that Spain's
highest official, the governor, disavowed the act, the fire was in the
stubble. The intendant was stubborn and the fighting temper waxed hot.
Both the governor and the Spanish envoy at Washington disavowed the
act again and rebuked the subordinate. Congress was soothed, but not
so the people of the West and South. They were fully aware, as have
been all our frontiersmen and pioneers from the beginning, that the
Mississippi and all the lands it waters are the organic structure of
unity and successful settlement on this continent. The Pacific and
Atlantic coast strips, even the great but bleak valley of the St.
Lawrence, are mere incidents of territorial unity and political
control when compared with the great alluvion of the Mississippi. This
was unknown, utterly unknown, and worse yet, entirely indifferent to
our statesmen. Madison certainly, and possibly Jefferson, believed
that western immigration <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> would pause and end on the east bank
of the Father of Waters.</p>

<p>Yet party government was a necessity under the American system, and
Jefferson's ladder, the Republican party, would be knocked into its
component parts should the West and South, noisy, exacting, and
turbulent, desert and go over to the expiring faction of the
Federalists; nay, worse, it might be forced into almost complete
negation of its own existence by a forced adoption of the Federalist
policy, alliance with Great Britain&mdash;monarchic and
aristocratic&mdash;rather than with radical and democratic France. What
could a distracted partizan do? Jefferson was adroit and inventive. He
sent James Monroe to negotiate with Bonaparte for the purchase of New
Orleans and both Floridas at the price of two millions, or upward to
ten, for all or part, whatever he could get; he was not even to
disdain the deposit or storage right, if nothing else could be had,
and if he could get nothing, he was to await instructions. With such
credentials he sailed on March eighth, 1803. A peace-lover must
sometimes speak low and small, even as cowards sometimes do. Three
weeks later appeared in New Orleans Laussat, the advance agent of
French occupation; Victor and his troops were to follow. It is not
possible to conceive that a foreign policy could be more perplexing,
confused, or uncertain than that of the philosophic theorist who is
the hero of the strict-constructionist party in these United States.</p>

<p>Robert R. Livingston, the regular American envoy at Paris, had, under
his instructions from home, worked with skill and zeal on the
spoliation claims and incidentally on the question of the Mississippi
and the Floridas. While the colonization schemes of Bonaparte seemed
feasible, Livingston made no headway whatever, except to extort an
admission that the spoliation claims were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> just. Neither
Talleyrand nor Livingston was much concerned about the great
Northwest. The American was clear that the importance of any control
lay in the possession of New Orleans, and on April eleventh, 1803, he
said so to the French minister, vigorously and squarely declaring
further that a persistent refusal of our request would unite us with
Great Britain to the serious discomfiture of France in her colonial
aspirations. This was said with some asperity, for Livingston had been
aware that the First Consul wanted all negotiation transferred to
Washington under the guidance of a special envoy, the wilful
Bernadotte, sent for the purpose; and now, worse yet, he himself was
to be superseded by Monroe. He had been a diligent and even
importunate negotiator; it was a ray of comfort in later days to
recall that the first suggestion for the sale of all Louisiana was
made to him in that momentous interview.</p>

<p>What had occurred Livingston could not know. It was this. On the
morning of that very day there reached the Tuileries despatches giving
in full detail an account of the tremendous preparations making in
England for the renewal of war both by land and sea. Bonaparte's
impatience knew no bounds. Hitherto he had concealed his true policy
of sale behind a scheme to spend the purchase-money on internal
improvements in France, and he had on his work-table map-outlines for
five great canals. Now, at daybreak, he summoned Barbé-Marbois,
sometime French consul-general in the United States, an official of
state with a thorough knowledge of our affairs, and ordered that a
negotiation for the sale, not of the Floridas and New Orleans, but of
all Louisiana, should immediately be opened with Livingston. He fixed
the price at fifty million francs. The envoy could of course do
nothing, but he thought thirty millions enough. Next day Monroe
arrived at Havre, and reaching Paris <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> on the thirteenth, that
very same day Barbé-Marbois and our two great statesmen began to
treat. Upon Monroe and Livingston devolved a momentous responsibility.
To Monroe by a most indefinite implication was left a certain liberty,
for under no circumstances whatsoever was he to end a negotiation if
once it was begun. And here, instead of minimizing terms, was, so to
speak, a great universe of land tender. But we had not so easily
thrown off the bright and glistening garment of righteousness as had
Napoleon Bonaparte, and in the minds of both Americans was the
question, non-existent for the First Consul, as he himself squarely
said, of whether the inhabitants of the district, men and women, human
souls, could be dealt in as chattels are.</p>

<p>Livingston had already seen darkly as in a glass what possession of
the west might do for the United States. Bonaparte's contributions to
the discussion were terse and trenchant. If he did not transfer the
title right speedily, a British fleet would take possession almost in
a twinkling; the transfer, he said, might in three centuries make
America the rival of Europe; why not? it was a long way ahead; but, on
the other hand, there never had been an enduring confederation, and
this one in America was unlikely to begin the series; finally, he
wanted the cash, as the United States wanted the land. Let there be no
delay. And there was none. The terms of the sale and the facts of the
transfer do not concern us here. In Bonaparte the United States had no
friend; but what the ancient régime began in helping to establish
American independence, the First Consul completed; for, thanks to him,
the war of 1812 was fought for commercial liberty, while the
exploitation of Louisiana has made the nation what it is to-day. The
great territory, with all its responsibilities and possibilities, made
the United States a world power; a puny enough power at first, but it
has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> grown. Jefferson and his agents were primarily statesmen
for the purpose of existing conditions, and in Monroe's mission
desired a remedy solely and entirely for party evils. They had,
however, the courage to accept the fortune forced upon them, even
though in their case, as in that of Bonaparte, it entailed, we repeat,
a complete reversal of all the political and party principles of the
platform on which they had hitherto stood.</p>

<p>The change wrought by the Louisiana purchase in American life and
culture was simply revolutionary. Hitherto in our weakness we had
faced backward, varying between two ideas of European alliance. We
virtually had British and French parties. Jefferson, who represented
the latter, thought of no other alternative in his trouble than to
strike hands with England. With Louisiana on our hands, we turned our
faces to our own front door. The Louisiana we bought had no Pacific
outlet in reality, but the Lewis and Clark expedition gave it one, and
that we have broadened by war and by purchase until we control the
western shore of the continent. Under such engrossing cares we ceased
to think of either French or British ties, except as exasperating, and
became not merely Americans, but, realizing Washington's aspirations,
turned into real continentals, with a scorn of all entanglements
whatever. In the occupation and settlement of Louisiana the slavery
question became acute, and the struggle to expand that system over
Louisiana soil precipitated the Civil War.</p>

<p>But if the change in national outlook was radical, that in
constitutional attitude was even more so. The constitutions of our
original states were the expression of political habits in a
community, the Federal Constitution was in the main a transcript of
those elements which were common in some degree to all the British
colonies. It was an age of written constitutions, because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span>
the flux of institutions was so rapid that men needed a mooring for
the substantial gains they had made. The past was so recent that
statesmen were timid, and they wanted their metes and bounds to be
fixed by a monument. Nothing was more natural than to pause and fall
back on the record thus made permanent, and strict construction was
and long continued to be a political fetish. The Louisiana purchase
was a circumstance of the first importance in party struggle. Yet
neither Federalist nor Republican dared, after mature deliberation, to
urge the question of constitutional amendment as essential to meet the
crisis thus precipitated. The enormous price entailed what was felt to
be an intolerable burden of taxation, and in the uproar of spoken and
printed debate played no small part. But the vital question was
whether the adjustment of new relations was constitutional.</p>

<p>Never did the kaleidoscope of politics display a more surprising
reversal of effect. The loose-construction party lost its wits
entirely, while the strict constructionists suddenly became the
apostles not of verbal but of logical construction. Jefferson violated
his principles in signing the treaty, but he was easily persuaded that
amendment was not necessary, that on the contrary the treaty-making
power covered the case completely. This was not conquest, which would
have been covered by the war power, but purchase, which is covered by
the treaty power, surrendered, like the other, by the states to the
federal government. The Federalists were represented in the House by
Gaylord Griswold; in the Senate by Ross and Pickering. Their
resistance was identical in both factious to the highest degree. They
contended that the executive had usurped the powers of Congress by
regulating commerce with foreign powers and by incorporating foreign
soil and foreign people with the United States, this last being a
power which it was doubtful <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> whether Congress possessed.
Supposing, however, that New Orleans became American, how could a
treaty be valid which gave preferential treatment to that single port
in admitting French and Spanish ships on equal terms with those owned
by Americans? The treaty, they asseverated, was therefore
unconstitutional and, even worse, impolitic, because we were unfitted
and did not desire to incorporate into our delicately balanced system
peoples different in speech, faith, and customs from ourselves. They
were, however, only mildly opposed to expansion; they were determined
and captious in the interpretation of the Constitution. The party in
power were avowedly expansionist; their retort was equally dialectic
and vapid. The whole discussion would have been empty except for
Pickering's contention that there existed no power to incorporate
foreign territory into the United States, as was stipulated by the
treaty. The House had resolved, ninety to twenty-five, to provide the
money and had appointed a committee on provisional government; the
Senate ratified the treaty, twenty-six to five.</p>

<p>What made the debates and action of Congress epochal was the
Federalist contention that Thomas Jefferson as provisional and interim
governor was nothing more or less than an American despot in
succession to a Spanish tyrant. Where was the Constitution now; where
would it be when in appointing the necessary officials&mdash;executive,
judicial, and legislative&mdash;he would usurp not merely Spanish despotism
but the powers of both the other branches of the federal government?
The Republicans quibbled, too; to appoint these three classes of
officials was not to exercise their powers. But they confirmed in
unanswerable logic a distinction thus far only mooted in our political
history&mdash;that between states and territories. Already presidential
appointees were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> exercising all three powers in Mississippi
and Indiana. This clenched the contentions of the Republicans, and the
bill for provisional government passed by an overwhelming vote on
October thirty-first. Both parties throughout the struggle had tacitly
abandoned the position that Congress possessed merely delegated powers
and nothing further except the ability to carry them into effect. Both
therefore admitted the possible interpretation of the Constitution
under stress of necessity, and the Federalists in their quibbling
contentions lost hold everywhere except in New England. That section
saw its influence eclipsed by the preponderance of Southern and
Western power and ere long was ripe for secession.</p>

<p>Volumes have been written and more will be on the romance of the
Louisiana purchase; Josiah Quincy threatened the dismemberment of the
Union when the present state of Louisiana was admitted in 1812; but
for Jefferson's wisdom in exploration it might have remained a
wilderness long after settlement began; Great Britain coveted it in
1815 when Jackson saved it; Aaron Burr probably coveted an empire
within it; Napoleon III had dreams of its return to the new France he
was to found in Mexico. Excluding the Floridas, which Spain would not
concede as a part of it, and the Oregon country, the territory thus
acquired was greater than that of Great Britain, Germany, France,
Spain, Portugal, and Italy combined. Its agricultural and mineral
resources were, humanly speaking, inexhaustible. No wonder it excited
the cupidity as it stirred the imagination of mankind; no wonder if
men avid to retain their power were dismayed at the preponderance it
was sure to exert eventually in a federal union of states. At the
present moment fourteen of our commonwealths, with a population of
about sixteen millions and a taxable wealth of seven billions, occupy
its soil. By the time we are fifty <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> years older, at the
present rate of settlement, these will contain about a third of the
power in the Union as determined by numbers and prosperity. All of
them, however, were from the first administrative districts, never
states, and by the retroactive influence of this fact state
sovereignty has thus been made an empty phrase.</p>

<p>And this leads us to remember that, if the Louisiana purchase
revolutionized our national outlook, our constitutional attitude, and
our sectional control, it quite as radically changed our national
texture. From that hour to this we have called to the masses of Europe
for help to develop the wilderness, and they have come by millions,
until now the men and women of Revolutionary stock probably number
less than fifteen millions in the entire country. These later
Americans have, like the migrations of the Norsemen in central and
southern Europe, proved so conservative in their Americanism that they
outrun their predecessors in loyalty to its essentials. They made the
Union as it now is, in a very high sense, and there is no question
that in the throes of civil war it was their blood which flowed at
least as freely as ours in its defense. It is they who have kept us
from developing on colonial lines and have made us a nation separate
and apart. This it is which has prevented the powerful influence of
Great Britain from inundating us, while simultaneously two
English-speaking peoples have reacted one upon the other in their
radical differences to keep aflame the zeal for exploration,
beneficent occupation, and general exploitation of the globe in the
interests of a high civilization. The localities of the Union have
been stimulated into such activities that manufactures and agriculture
have run a mighty race; commerce alone lags, and no wonder, for
Louisiana gave us a land world of our own, a home market more valuable
than both the Indies or the continental mass of the Far East.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Summary</p>

<p>If Napoleon's qualities as usurper, statesman, and warrior be as
remarkable as they appear, why was his time so short, what were the
causes of his decline, and what is his place in history? The causes of
his decline may be summed up in a single word&mdash;exhaustion. There
exists no record of human activity more complete than is that of
Napoleon Bonaparte's life. In its beginnings we can see this worshiper
of power stimulating his immature abilities in vain until, with
reckless desperation, he closed the period of training and made his
scandalous bargain with Barras; then, grown suddenly, inexplicably
rich, becoming with better clothing, food, and lodging physically more
vigorous, he seems mercilessly to drive the rowels into his own flanks
until initiative, ingenuity, and ruthlessness are displayed with
apparently superhuman dimensions. The period of achievement is short,
but glorious in politics; the age of domination is long and exciting.
Throughout both there is the same wanton physical excess and
intellectual dissipation. Then comes the turn. Every human age has in
it the germs of the next; we begin to die at birth, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> the
characteristic qualities and powers of one period diminish as those of
the next increase. So it was with Napoleon. He compressed so much,
both as regards the number and importance of events, into so short a
space that his times are like those wrinkled Japanese pictures which
are made by shriveling a large print into a small compass&mdash;intense and
deep, but unreal. To change the metaphor, he found the ship of state
dashing onward, with her helm lashed and no one daring to take the
task of the steersman in hand. He cut the lashings and laid hold. His
unassisted efforts as a pilot gave the vessel a new course; but he had
no steam or other mechanical power, no <i>deus ex machinâ</i>, to aid him;
and, as the storm increased, exhaustion followed; he seemed to be
steering when, in reality, his actions were under the compulsion of
events he was not controlling; and this continued until the wreck.</p>

<p>But the inertia of his powers resembled their rise so perfectly as to
represent continuous growth, and thus to deceive observers: in a few
years he had ordered the Revolutionary chaos of western Europe to his
liking, and the resultant organization worked by the principles he had
infused into it. As he saw his imperfect and shallow theories of
society successively confounded, he had no vigor left to reconstruct
them and adapt himself to new situations. His efforts at the rôle of
liberator throughout the Hundred Days deserve careful study. He simply
could not yield or adapt himself, except in non-essentials. The shifts
to which he had resort would have been ridiculous had they not been
pathetic. The governmental forms attempted by the Revolution had been
successively destroyed by the furious energy of Jacobinism: the
Directory was but a compromise, and when it took refuge for safety in
the army its performances seemed to the masses sure to bring back the
Terror; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> the Consulate was only a disguised monarchy founded
on military force; and as royalism was impossible, there seemed to
vast numbers no other alternative than the Empire. That there was no
other alternative was due to Napoleon's imperious character, now
developed to its utmost extent. He was selfish, hardened, and, though
active like his symbolic bee, without capacity for further
development. His mother knew that he could not hold out; she said it,
and saved money for a rainy day. He himself had haunting premonitions
of this truth. His passion to perpetuate himself by founding a dynasty
was the real basis for his warlike ardor. Profoundly moved, in fact
awe-stricken, by the imperishable hatred of the older dynasties, and
yet reveling in his military genius, he waged war ruthlessly and with
zest, enjoying the discomfiture of his foes, and delighting in the
exercise of his powers. But, after all, war was but a means. He
frequently dwelt on the advantages of hereditary succession; he
lingered with suspicious frequency over the satisfaction a dynastic
ruler must feel in the devotion or, if not that, in the submissiveness
of his people; he was hypersensitive to the slightest popular
disturbance; and he must have foreboded his own fall, since he was
accustomed to wear poison in an amulet around his neck, so that when
the great crisis should arrive he might take his own life. "Ah! why am
I not my grandson?" he longingly ejaculated.</p>

<p>This single cause of Napoleon's fall can be better seen in the record
of his second captivity than in any other portion of his life. There
is no such thing as absolute exhaustion short of death. But
intermittent and flickering exertion is symptomatic of failing powers
in a jaded horse; it forebodes the end in a worn-out man. Cheerful and
busy at first, because recruited by a long and favorable sea-voyage,
he set out in St. Helena at a racing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> gait to write history
and mold the public opinion of Europe. Playful and energetic, he
caught together the scanty remnants of his momentary grandeur, and
emulated the masters of ceremony at the Tuileries in organizing a
court and issuing edicts for the conduct of its little affairs. His
life was to be that of a caged lion&mdash;caged, but yet a lion. The plan
would not work. In the affairs of Longwood there were, as everywhere,
hitches and irregularities. To Napoleon these soon became not the
incidents, but the substance of life. With the departure of his
secretaries the business of biographical composition became first
irksome, then impossible, and the poor muse of history was finally
turned out of doors. To regular exercise succeeded spasmodic
over-exertion; complaint became the subject-matter for the exercise of
both mind and tongue; daily association with kindly but second-rate
persons checked the flow of great ideas; the combinations of
Austerlitz and Wagram gave place to the small moves in a game of spite
with a bureaucratic British governor. From the days of his boyhood
until his alliance with Barras the exile had been a dreamy, vague,
indefinite, unsuccessful fellow; his powers were not quickly
developed. While he had France and Europe to work upon, he showed the
extraordinary qualities repeatedly outlined, mind and hand, thought
and deed, working together. Already jaded, his stupendous capacity
became intermittent after the fatal armistice of Poischwitz; but it
worked, for it still had the raw material of grand strategy and great
politics to work on. This continued until after Waterloo. That battle,
not a great one in itself, was nevertheless epic, both in its effects
upon the world and in its ruin of the brains which had swayed the
destinies of Europe for twenty years. Between the flight to Charleroi
and the escape to the <i>Bellerophon</i>, Napoleon shows no pluck and no
brains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> In actual captivity his mind was without a sufficient task
and under no pressure from necessity. It consequently, though somewhat
invigorated at first, intermitted more and more toward the close,
working, when it did work, awkwardly and with friction, until the
physical collapse came, and the end was reached. The attempts to
remodel history, the efforts to delineate his own and others' motives,
the specious summaries of his career and its epochs, the fragmentary
expositions of his philosophy in ethics, politics, and psychology&mdash;all
the stately volumes which bear his name, his literary remains, in
fact, present a pitiful sight when closely examined. They are but the
scoriæ of a burnt-out mind, but dust and ashes; a splendid mass, but
an extinct volcano. It was only natural that his successors and
admirers should seek to erect a more enduring foundation for his fame
by collecting and carefully editing what he had written when at his
best, when acting according to his momentary, normal impulse, and
when, therefore, he had the least pose and the greatest sincerity. But
it is a proof of their shrewdness that they selected and published
less and less after Erfurt, and that out of the voluminous pen-product
of St. Helena they chose a hundred and fifty pages which the
"Correspondence," intended to be the most splendid monument to the
Emperor's glory, could present as authentic biographical material.</p>

<p>If, then, Napoleon was after all but a plain man, how did he become a
personage? Simply because he was the typical man of his day, less the
personal mediocrity; the typical burgher in personal character, the
typical soldier in war, the typical despot in peace, and the typical
idealist in politics; capable in all these qualities of analysis;
capable, consequently, of being understood; capable of exhaustion and
of being overwhelmed by combinations. In other words, he was really
great because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> he was the shrewd common-sense personage of his
age, considering the ideal social structure as a level of comfort in
money, in shelter, in food, in clothes, in religion, in morality, in
decency, in domestic good-nature, in the commonplace good things
fairly divided as far as they would go round. This was the side of his
nature which in a period of social exhaustion planted him four-square
as a social force, presented him to France as the rock against which
the "red fool-fury" of Jacobinism had dashed itself to pieces, and
gave him for a time command of all hearts. Thus established, he at
once fell heir to French tradition&mdash;that is, to the continuous policy
of the nation in foreign and domestic affairs; which was that France
should be the Jupiter in the Olympus of European nations by reason of
her excellence both in beauty and in strength. Here was a temptation
not to be resisted, the superlative temptation like that of the
serpent and the woman, the chance to transcend by knowledge, the
opportunity to "hitch his wagon to a star," to commingle the glory of
France with his own until the elements were no longer separable. Into
this snare, great as he was in his representative plainness, he fell,
and in the ensuing confusion he not only destroyed himself, but
brought the proud and splendid nation which had cherished him to the
very verge of destruction. He could not sway one emancipated people
without swaying an emancipated Europe, and this after Austerlitz he
determined to do. Then he lost his head: his wisdom turned out to be
nothing but adoration of mere expediency; his strength proved weakness
when, with his imperial idealism, he braved in Spain the idealism of a
true nation; his vaunted physical endurance disappeared with
self-indulgence, the golden head and brazen loins fell in a crash as
the feet of clay disintegrated before the storm of national
uprisings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> This being true, we have in his career every element of epic
greatness: a colossal man, a chaotic age, the triumph of principle,
the reëstablishment of historical equilibrium by means of a giant cast
away when no longer needed. And this epic quality, which is not in the
man alone nor in the age alone, appears when the two are combined, and
then only. Looking at him in our cold light, he has every attribute of
the commonplace adventurer; looking at the France of 1786 with our
perspective, the people and the times appear almost mad in their
frantic efforts to accomplish the work of ages in the moments of a
single lifetime. Yet combine the two, and behold the man of the third
estate rising, advancing, reflecting, and then planting himself in the
foreground as the most dramatic figure of public life, and you have a
scene, a stage, and actors which cannot be surpassed in the range of
history. To the end of the Consulate the action is powerful, because
it represents reality: a nation unified, a people restored to
wholesome influences, peace inaugurated, constitutional government
established. There is so far no tawdry decoration, no fine clothes, no
posing, no ranting. But with the next scene, that of the Empire, the
spectator becomes aware of all these annoyances, and more. The leading
actor grows self-conscious, identifies himself with the public
interest for personal ends and to the detriment of the nation,
displays no moral or artistic self-restraint, and soon arranges every
element so as to make his studied personal ambitions appear like the
resultants of ominous forces which act from without, and against which
he is donning the armor of despotism for the public good. The play
becomes a human tragicomedy, and, verging to its close, ends, like the
tragedies of the Greeks, with a people betrayed and the force of the
age chained to a torrid rock as the sport of the elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> Was this the end, and did Napoleon have no place in history,
as many historians have lately been contending? Far from it. From his
couch of porphyry beneath the gilded dome on the banks of the Seine,
the Emperor, though "dead and turned to clay," still exercises a
powerful sway. The actual Napoleonic Empire had, as we have before
remarked, a striking resemblance to those of Alexander and
Charlemagne. Based, as were these, upon conquest, and continued for a
little life by the idealism of a single person, it seemed like a
brilliant bubble on the stream of time. But Alexander hellenized the
civilization of his day, and prepared the world for Christianity;
Charlemagne plowed, harrowed, and sowed the soil of barbaric Europe,
making it receptive for the most superb of all secular ideals, that of
nationality; Napoleon tore up the system of absolutism by the roots,
propagated in the most distant lands of Europe the modern conception
of individual rights, overthrew the rotten structure of the
German-Roman empire, and in spite of himself regenerated the
long-abused ideas of nationality and fatherland. It must be confessed
that his own shallow political science, the second-hand Rousseauism he
had learned from his desultory reading, had little to do with this,
except negatively. One by one he saw his faiths made ridiculous by the
violent phases of Jacobinism after it took control of the
Revolutionary movement. His heart, his conscience, his intellect, all
undisciplined, then revolted against the metaphysic which had misled
him, and "ideologist" became his most contemptuous epithet. Controlled
by instinct and ambition, he nevertheless remained throughout his
period the one thorough idealist among the men of action, Goethe being
the superlative, transcendent genius of idealism among the thinkers.
Each successive day saw his scorn of physical limitations increase,
his impatience of language, customs, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> laws, of local
attachment, personal fidelity, and national patriotism grow. The
result was a fixed conviction that for humanity at large all these
were naught. At last he planted himself upon the burgher philosophy of
utility and expediency, putting his faith in the loyalty of his
family, in homely dependence upon matrimonial alliance, in the passion
of humanity for physical ease and earthly well-being. This was the
concert by which he sought to create a federation of beneficent
kingdoms that would win all men to the prime mover. Space and time
rebelled; the lofty ideals of humanity and philosophy would not down;
selfishness proved impotent as a support; the dreamer recognized that
again he had been deceived. Haggard and exhausted, he finally turned,
in the rôle of Napoleon Liberator, to the notion of nationality and of
government swayed by popular will in all its phases. But it was too
late. Instead of being the leader of a van, he had forgotten, in his
own phrase, to keep pace with the march of ideas, and was a straggler
in the rear, without a moral status or a devoted following.</p>

<p>All this is true; but it is equally true that much of his work endured
both in France and in the civilized world. In France, indeed, the work
he did has been in some details only too enduring. History is there to
tell us that the test of high civilization is not necessarily in great
dimensions. Those histories of the ancient world in which humanity
seems strange and distasteful, of Egypt, Phenicia, Babylon, and
Assyria, were wide in extent and long in duration: those of Greece and
Rome, whose poets, statesmen, legislators, and warriors are our
despair, were small in proportion and comparatively short in duration,
while they were normal and healthy; the world-empires of both were
neither natural nor admirable. It will not do, therefore, to judge
Napoleon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> by the length of his career, nor by the standards of
other times and different circumstances. The centralization of
administration in the commonwealth which he rescued from the clutches
of anarchy was probably essential to the rescue; the expediency which
he deliberately cultivated in the Concordat, in the laws of the family
and inheritance, and in the fatal Continental System, was possibly a
statesman's palliative for momentary political disease. His artificial
aristocracy, his system of great fiefs, his financial shifts&mdash;who
dares to say that these institutions did not meet a temporary want?
Moreover, it is worth considering whether a direct reaction to
moderate, sane republicanism from extreme and furious Jacobinism was
possible at all, and whether a reaction from Napoleon's imperial
democracy was not easier and the results more permanent. In other
words, is it likely that the third French republic could have been the
direct successor of the first? The question is certainly debatable. No
pen can so delineate the sufferings of France under Napoleonic
institutions as that of Taine has so ably and scathingly done; his
wonderful etching powerfully exhibits painful truths. But who is to
blame if a nation is hampered by its administration, by a
centralization it no longer needs, by social regulations which it has
outgrown, by political habits which do not suit the age? Not alone the
man who inaugurated them, for ends partly selfish but also partly
statesmanlike; the people who timidly endure are responsible for the
doom which will certainly overtake any nation living in a social and
political structure antiquated and unsuitable.</p>

<p>One thing at least the new France has done with magisterial style: she
has introduced into her political machinery respect for political
habit. The French government of to-day is distinctly an outgrowth of
conditions, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> not of theories. Its constitution has none of
the fatal marks of completeness which her other republican
constitutions have borne; on the contrary, there never was a period in
modern times when to the outsider French institutions seemed as
crescive as they do to-day. And they have abundant material on which
to work. There are signs that the system of nations as armed camps,
for which Napoleon set the example, is breaking by its own weight;
modern armies are mostly national schools controlled by scientific
inquisitiveness and permeated by a civic spirit; the pacific federal
system of the great European powers sometimes seems feeble and
rickety, but it is in existence. Alliances are now federations for
peace; the Triple Alliance continues to be a federation for peace; so
too the Sextuple Alliance, so energetic and persistent in its support
of Turkey, has been a federation for peace. Perhaps the day is nearer
than we think when the Hague tribunal shall develop a vigorous,
practical working system of international understandings, without
appeal to war. Then certainly, but long before, let us hope, France
may anchor her liberties in a bill of rights, destroy judicial
inquisition, begin to slacken the bonds of her prefectoral system,
emancipate her universities and academies, regenerate public feeling
as to the increase of population by modifying her laws of the family,
and go on not only to populate her own fertile fields, but to make the
magnificent colonies which she has acquired the future homes of
countless children, a field for exerting her superfluous energy&mdash;in
short, when she may slough off her now superfluous Napoleonic
institutions.</p>

<p>It would be utterly unjust, however, to plead a justification of
Napoleon solely by such a monumental fact as that he was in all
likelihood the forerunner of modern France. Even when the country
adopted him, his positive, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> direct influence for good was
great. The Concordat whatever its faults, partly secured a free church
and a free state, separating thus what God had never joined together
in holy wedlock; his splendid codes&mdash;for no matter who pondered and
shaped them, they were his in execution&mdash;have guaranteed the
perpetuity of civil equality not only in France, but, as the sequel
has shown, throughout great expanses of Europe; the questions of a
nation's right to its chosen ruler and government, agitated in a new
form during the Hundred Days, were those with which succeeding
generations were concerned until they were answered in the
affirmative. The difference between the France of 1802 and that of
1815 is on one side painful, but on another side it is remarkably
significant. The former was transitional and chaotic; the latter had
that amazing but completed social union, stronger than any ever known
in history, which has saved the country in succeeding storm-periods.
In it there was respect for persons, for contract, for property; the
administration was unitary, homogeneous, and active; the finances,
though not regulated, were restored to vigor; and the processes were
inaugurated by which the great cities of France have become healthful
and beautiful, while at the same time the internal improvements of the
country have been systematized and rendered splendid in their
efficiency. Revolutionary concepts were so modified and assimilated
that the efforts of the dynasties, when put to the test of public
opinion, failed because they were felt to be absurd by the masses. It
was one of Napoleon's aphorisms that "to have the right of using
nations, you must begin by serving them well." Like a good burgher, he
made his servants comfortable and happy. His example, moreover, was
reflected abroad throughout Europe; and to the millions of plain and
not very shrewd inhabitants of other lands, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> the Revolution,
as Napoleon had shaped it, lost many of the horrors with which
Jacobinism, to the everlasting damnation of both the thing and its
name, had clothed it. It is a question whether there was in existence
a strong liberal France, such as idealists depict, that could
pacifically have done this wonderful work. Examining and duly weighing
the desperation of dynastic absolutism, it looks as if nothing but the
counter-poison of Napoleon's militarism could have prevented its
annihilating French liberalism. Without Napoleon the conservative
liberalism of to-day would have been impossible.</p>

<p>Turning to the field of general history, there are certain facts,
admittedly Napoleon's doing, which quite as certainly are among the
most important factors of contemporary politics. Of themselves these
would suffice to give him a high place in constructive history. In the
first place, he deprived England of the monopoly in what had long been
essentially and peculiarly her political ideal. What was the basis of
the long conflict between England and France to which Napoleon fell
heir? Was the struggle of these two glorious and enlightened sister
nations a struggle for territorial ascendancy in Europe? Not entirely.
Was it a life-and-death struggle for ascendancy in the western world?
No. The Seven Years' War had decided that question against France, and
the American war for independence had in a sense evened the score in
its decision against England; for the prize had been awarded to a new
people. No; the conflict did not rage over this. What, then, was the
cause? Nothing less than a passion for the ascendancy of one of these
highest forms of civilization throughout the globe, including both
Europe and America. This Anglo-Saxon political, commercial, religious,
and social conception was, after the Napoleonic wars, no longer
confined to Great Britain. Thence onward the great powers of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span>
Europe have been chiefly concerned, aside from their care for
self-preservation, in partitioning Africa and Asia among themselves;
and this process is no sooner complete than they begin to murmur about
the Monroe doctrine and to cast longing eyes toward Central and South
America. The state system which was once European has become
coextensive with the sphere on which we live, and this notion of
world-domination, so denounced when held by Napoleon, has become the
motive-power of every great modern civilization.</p>

<p>If we consider the national politics of Europe beyond the boundaries
of France, history again becomes a record of influences started by
Napoleon's works, either of commission or of omission. Russia's
grandeur as a European power appears to be largely due to the
temporary extinction of Poland's hope for national resurrection. Had
Napoleon, instead of playing his doubtful game with the grand duchy of
Warsaw, turned into an autonomous permanency the scarcely known
provisional government of Poland, which he actually inaugurated and
which worked for a considerable time, and had he restored to its sway
both the Prussian and Austrian shares in the shameless partition, we
might have seen quite another result to the military migration of
1812. We can scarcely doubt, moreover, that Poland, restored under
French protection, would have been a buffer state between Russia,
Prussia, and Austria, rendering the crushing coalition an
impossibility in 1813, while in 1814 the allies could probably never
have crossed the French frontier, if indeed they had dared to go even
so far in their march across Europe. But his positive achievement was
quite as important. The Germany of to-day is a great federal state
guided, but not dominated, by Prussia. What are its other important
members? Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden&mdash;all three in their present
extent and influence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> the creations of Napoleon; the nice
balance of powers in the German Empire is due to his arrangement of
the map. There is even a sense in which all Germany, as we know it,
sprang full armed from his head. He not merely taught the peoples of
central Europe their strategy, tactics, and military organization: it
was he who carried the standard of enlightenment (in his own interest,
of course, but still he carried it) through the length and breadth of
their territories, and made its significance clear to the meanest
intellect of their teeming millions. Thereafter the longings for
German unity, for German fatherland, for the organization of German
strength into one movement, could never be checked. The swarm of petty
tyrants who had modeled their life and conduct on the example of Louis
XIV, and who in struggling to vie with his villainies had debauched
themselves and their peoples, was swept away by Napoleon's
ruthlessness, to give place to the larger, more wholesome nationality
of the nineteenth century, which was destined in the end to inspire
the surrounding nations with the new concept of respect, not alone for
one's own nationality, but for that of others.</p>

<p>What French influence effected in Italy is a topic so recondite as to
require separate discussion; for the results were not so immediate or
so dramatic as they were in Germany. But the destruction of petty
governments was as ruthless as in the north; the ideas which marched
in Bonaparte's ranks found at least a large minority of intelligent
admirers among the invaded; and Italian unity, though won by a family
he feared and abused, is in no doubtful sense indebted for its
existence, not merely to Napoleon's age, but to the ideas he
disseminated and to the efforts at a practical beginning which he
made. As to Austria-Hungary, the new historical epoch which makes her
essentially the empire of the lower Danube <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> takes its rise
from Napoleon's time and influence. The relaxation of her grasp on
Italy has thrown her across the Adriatic for the territorial expansion
essential to her position as a great power. It has been her mission to
rescue by moral influence some of the fairest lands in the Balkan
peninsula from waste and anarchy. Mere proximity is a powerful factor;
the turbulence of Austrian local patriotism has been the seed of
wholesome discontent among the Christian populations of Turkey, whose
first awakening was largely due to the emissaries sent by Napoleon to
fire the hearts of the oppressed and suffering subjects of that
distracted land. Servia is one example of this; and in a sense the
national awakening of Greece began with the hopes similarly aroused.</p>

<p>The astounding magic of his name in the United States is partly due to
a quality of the American mind which makes its possessor the
passionate and indiscriminating adorer of greatness in every form. The
Americans are more French than the French in their admiration of
power. But, after all, this is not the main reason for their interest
in Napoleon. They are, dimly at least, aware of certain facts which
have determined their history and made them an independent nation;
though already stated and discussed, we may be pardoned for
recapitulating them in this connection. Their first war for
independence left them tributary to the mother-country both
industrially and commercially. It was Napoleon who pitilessly, though
slyly and indirectly, launched them into the second war with Great
Britain, from which they emerged with some glory and some sense of
defeat, but, after all, with the tremendous and permanent gain of
absolute commercial independence. In the second place, their purchase
of Louisiana, though understood by only a few at the moment,
revolutionized their national system both inside and outside. That
momentous step destroyed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> the literal interpretation of the
constitution, hitherto enslaving a congeries of jarring little
commonwealths in the bondage of verbalism, because, though manifestly
beneficent and necessary, it could be justified before the law only by
an appeal to the spirit and not to the letter. Thenceforward Americans
have steadily been enlarging their constitutional law by
interpretation, and the apparent timidity of amendment which they
display is simply due to the absence of necessity for revision as long
as expansion by interpretation continues. But certainly quite as
important as this was also the displacement, by the acquisition of
that vast territory, of what may be called the national center of
gravity. Until then the aspirations of Americans had been toward
Europe; the public opinion of the country had, until then, demanded
the largest possible intercourse with that continent compatible with
freedom from political entanglement. Thereafter there was a change in
their spirit: a continent of their own was open to their energies. For
two generations their history has been concerned with exploration,
with mechanical invention, and with solving the great problem of how
to prevent an extension of slavery corresponding to the extension of
territory. But nevertheless, steadily and vigorously two correlated
concepts were propagating themselves: neglect of Europe, in order to
expand and assimilate their recent acquisition; industrial
exclusiveness, for the sake of this great home market which
immigration, settlement, and the formation of new commonwealths were
creating, not at the front door, but in the rear of the states
stretching along the Atlantic. This resulted in a temporary
"about-face" of the nation; and it is only now, when the prize of
material greatness and of territorial unity has been secured, that the
people turn once more toward the rising sun, in order to get from
older lands everything <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> germane to its own civilization, and
to assimilate these acquisitions, if possible, in realizing its own
ideals of moral grandeur.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> HISTORICAL SOURCES</h3>


<p>In making this book I had access to the following original sources:</p>

<p>I. Unpublished Documents: <i>a</i>, The papers of the French Ministry of
Foreign Affairs during the years of Napoleon's life, including those
of the "Fonds Napoléon." <i>b</i>, The unpublished correspondence of
Napoleon kept in the French Ministry of War, including the "Volumes
Rouges" and the "Dossier de l'Empereur." This is as voluminous at
least as the published correspondence, but of personal and technical
rather than political interest. I have also consulted the archives of
the General Staff in the same building concerning many events
connected with Napoleon's career. <i>c</i>, The papers of Napoleon's youth
known as the Ashburnham papers, but now owned by the Italian
government, and kept in the Laurentian Library at Florence. Since I
used them they have been published by Masson and Biagi, but the
editors have corrected the text to an extent which is in our day not
considered scientific. <i>d</i>, The despatches of American diplomatists
resident abroad during Napoleon's career. <i>e</i>, Certain papers from the
Record Office in London relating to Napoleon's surrender and his life
in St. Helena. <i>f</i>, Certain papers of Henri Beyle containing
characterizations of Napoleon and contemporary anecdotes concerning
him. These were translated by Jean de Mitty from a cipher manuscript
in the public library at Grenoble. <i>g</i>, A considerable number of
Napoleon's letters, kindly put at my disposal by various collectors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> II. Published Official Papers. Within the last few years
original documents concerning the Napoleonic epoch have been printed
very extensively. Nearly all the important books are based on archival
research, and the respective authors generally print a certain number
of despatches or reports in justification of their conclusions. The
following collections are the most important: <i>a</i>, The Correspondence
of Napoleon. <i>b</i>, Official Papers of the Helvetic Republic. <i>c</i>,
Diplomatic Correspondence between Prussia and France, 1795-97. <i>d</i>,
Lord Whitworth's despatches. <i>e</i>, Ducasse's Supplement to Napoleon's
Correspondence. <i>f</i>, The Papers of Gentz and Schwarzenberg. <i>g</i>, The
Papers of Metternich. <i>h</i>, Napoleon's Letters to Caulaincourt. <i>i</i>,
Napoleon's Letters to King Joseph. <i>j</i>, The Letters of King Jerome,
Queen Catharine, and King Frederick of Würtemberg. <i>k</i>, The Papers of
Castlereagh, Banks, Jackson, and other English statesmen of the time.
<i>l</i>, Diplomatic Correspondence between Russia and France. <i>m</i>, The
Archives of Count Woronzoff. <i>n</i>, Diplomatic Correspondence of the
Sardinian ambassadors at St. Petersburg. <i>o</i>, Diplomatic
Correspondence of the ministers of the republic and kingdom of Italy.
<i>p</i>, Lecestre's Unpublished Letters of Napoleon. This list might be
extended almost indefinitely by adding such collections as Ducasse's
Memoirs of King Joseph, Napoleon's Letters to Josephine, the
Correspondence of Eugène, etc., etc.; but these older books are too
well known to require enumeration, and, though authentic, are only
semi-official or personal publications.</p>

<p>III. Contemporary Memoirs. Those titles given in the bibliography are,
with a few exceptions, the most valuable. The positive, literal truth
of the so-called memoirs attributed to Bourrienne, Constant,
Caulaincourt, Barras, Fouché, and Avrillon is very slender. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span>
They are all made by skilful patchwork and must be read with the
utmost caution. In fact, it is doubtful whether, with the exception of
Barras's scandalous record, they have, strictly speaking, any right to
the names they bear. This much negative value they have: that they
show how history can be falsified in one interest or another.</p>

<p>During the fourteen years which have elapsed since the book was
completed for magazine publication, and the twelve since it was
revised to the form of four volumes, great numbers of what were then
manuscript journals, memoirs, or letters have been printed and
published; of these proper use has been made in this edition, and
their titles are given in the bibliography. The author may be pardoned
for remarking that few details of importance have been found
incorrect, wherever experts agree, and that his many critics have made
no demand for the reconstruction of his characterization in its broad
outlines, however opposed they may be to his portrayals or
discussions.</p>

<p>This list of books makes no pretense to completeness. It is a
conservative estimate that there are two hundred thousand titles of
books relating to Napoleon and his age. What is here given is
sufficient to assure the reader a complete view of Napoleon and his
times from the best sources.</p>

<b>Footnote 21:</b> Long regarded as a more or less haphazard decision, it
has been established at last that the officers of the Prussian general
staff were able by the light of a horn lantern so to exhibit their
maps, explain their study of the ground, and develop the necessary
strategy as to determine with considerable accuracy where they were
and what the scientific move should be. When this was duly set forth
in the history of the general staff, the exultation of the Emperor
William II was expressed in his public speeches, and the Germans of
the empire were convinced that by this decision the result of the
Waterloo campaign was determined.<a href="#footnotetag21"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>
